</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This ongoing qualitative study uses long interviews to seek to understand the lived experiences of individuals who participate in online church services.  Online church has rapidly grown in the past few years and many Americans have participated in, or are willing to participate in, alternatives to traditional worship. Many churches are adopting online formats as a way to address the interest of individuals in alternative worship experiences. This study seeks to understand how individuals use online worship and how it plays into their spiritual lives.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
