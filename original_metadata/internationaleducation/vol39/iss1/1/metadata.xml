<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study investigates learning outcomes of four-year-old children at a preschool in P. R. China. The children are educated in a school ecology designed to address cognitive, social, linguistic and psychological development, where an instructional technique, “Integrating Thinking, Art and Language” (ITAL), is applied to support them in developing multiple intelligences. A total of 67 beginning or pre-level I Chinese preschoolers participated in the study, whose learning in the first eight months under ITAL instruction is examined. Scenarios of ITAL instruction, children&#39;s samples and assessment of learning outcomes are reported and analyzed. Results indicate that the preschoolers demonstrated significant growth in art as well as other subjects, oral language expression and social interpersonal skills through producing and communicating about their artwork. Possible adjustments in applying ITAL are also suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
