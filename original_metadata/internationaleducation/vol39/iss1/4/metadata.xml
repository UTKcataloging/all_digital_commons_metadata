<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the source of social support (supervisors, colleagues, friends, spouse, and family) that would be the most efficient in reducing burnout among special education teachers. A sample of 83 special education teachers (43 men and 40 women) completed Burnout and Sources of Social Support questionnaires. Person correlation coefficients and ANOVA procedures were utilized to analyze data. Results revealed significant positive correlations between family support and personal accomplishments; marital status, age, and teaching experience were not significantly related to any of the three burnout dimensions. Results were interpreted and implications for special education teachers were suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
