</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Using a variation on Peter Elbow&#39;s believing game, I help students discover the degree to which Milton in Paradise Lost succeeds in his explicit attempt to justify God&#39;s ways to man and in that success also offers us an account of human happiness and misery that is psychologically sophisticated, spiritually illuminating, entirely rational, and supremely wise as a guide to living a humanly satisfying life. Such an approach to Paradise Lost also fosters an experience of the text through which many students undergo a modern version of the spiritual transformation and enlightenment that Milton explicitly aimed to make possible for readers of his epic.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
