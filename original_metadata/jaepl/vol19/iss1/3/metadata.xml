<value>Peter Elbow is Professor of English Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst where he directed the Writing Program. He taught at M.I.T., Franconia College, Evergreen State College, and SUNY Stony Brook where he also directed the Writing Program. He is author of Everyone Can Write: Essays Toward a Hopeful Theory of Writing and Teaching Writing. He’s also written Writing Without Teachers; Oppositions in Chaucer; Writing With Power; Embracing Contraries; What is English? And with Pat Belanoff he wrote a textbook, A Community of Writers. He has edited books of essays about voice in writing and about freewriting. Three of his essays have been given awards by the journals in which they appeared. The National Council of Teachers of English gave him the James Squire Award “for his transforming influence and lasting intellectual contribution”; in 2007 the Conference on College Composition and Communication gave him the Exemplar Award for “representing the highest ideals of scholarship, teaching, and service.” Writing With Elbow (Utah State UP) is a collection of essays by other scholars devoted to his work.</value>
