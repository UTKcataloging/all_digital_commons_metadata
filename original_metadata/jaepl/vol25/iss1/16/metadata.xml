</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This qualitative study examines the effects of the Mindfulness Journal Assignment (MJA), a semester-long integration implemented in five different university courses, to understand its potential for teaching and learning. Of particular interest were the patterns found in the reflective writing of students engaging in the MJA and the connection of those patterns to both classroom and Writing Across the Curriculum learning objectives. The most frequent themes occurring in the 111,906-word dataset were metacognitive awareness and self-regulation, both of which are significant for learning transfer and WAC. The findings of this study are promising in that the inclusion of a contemplative writing assignment is associated with positive habits of mind, such as metacognition and openness, which are prerequisites for common university course objectives such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and transfer. The development of these fundamental, domain-general skills makes this type of assignment an appropriate intervention for the emerging Contemplative Writing Across the Curriculum movement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
