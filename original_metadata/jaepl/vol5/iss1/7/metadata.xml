</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the usefulness of thought patterns from ancient rhetoric as they have been appropriated historically and as potentially applicable concepts for the present and future in today&#39;s interlinked electronic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier version of this paper, first delivered as part of a panel at the Rhetoric Society of America meeting at Tucson in May 1 996, was delivered and published as &quot;The Architectonics of Information: Ancient Topical Thought and Postmodern Cognition&quot; in Proceedings of the Mid-America Symposium on E merging Computer Technologies, October 1 996. (The published papers are available in &quot;Information Problems&quot; at http://www.ou.edu/cas/english/agora/). I would like to thank Jana Moring and Dianne Juby for their collaboration on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
