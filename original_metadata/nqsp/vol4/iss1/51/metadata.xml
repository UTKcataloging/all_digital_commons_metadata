<abstract>&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the efficiency of bait trapping and night lighting for capturing northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) from October 1993-March 1996 in central Missouri. Fifty-two percent of all birds were captured in bait traps and 48% were captured by night lighting. Of all birds captured for the first time, 59% were captured by trapping and 41 % by night lighting, demonstrating the value of using both techniques to capture a large sample size in a limited time.
