<abstract>&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the effectiveness of half-cutting honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) trees to increase northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) habitat and abundance in South Texas. We compared the effects of half-cutting on the survival of mesquite and its effects on understory vegetation on both treated and control areas monthly. Data were taken under the treeâ€™s canopy to determine understory plant species diversity, height, and density. We used bobwhite whistle counts, mark-recapture, and searched with trained dogs to determine the effects of half-cutting on bobwhite abundance. Half-cut young trees had 23.1% greater survival than did older half-cut trees. The area protected from grazing under half-cut trees was 10.2 times larger than that protected by control trees. Height of understory vegetation under half-cut trees was significantly (P = 0.005) taller then that under control trees. Treated areas supported more plant species than control areas but the difference was not significant (P = 0.072). Three bobwhite food plants had a positive response to half-cutting, whereas 3 were negatively affected. Half-cutting had no significant influence on numbers of cocks whistling (maximum 9 and 8 males calling/5-min period, respectively, for treatment and control). The number of bobwhite trapped on the half-cut area was 91 while only 75 were trapped on the control area. Trained bird dogs located 101 bobwhites on the half-cut areas and 78 on the control areas. The half-cut areas had the same number of coveys (10) as the control areas, however, covey sizes were larger (2.3 birds/covey) on the half-cut areas. We believe that half-cutting can add habitat and increase bobwhite abundance on many heavily grazed rangelands.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
