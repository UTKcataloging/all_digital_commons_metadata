</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The majority of male students enter the University of Tennessee with similar ACT scores and high school grade point averages. However, they are being retained at significantly lower rates when compared to their female counterparts. The discrepancy is even more pronounced among African-American males. As a result a male student committee was established in spring 2012 identify barriers and make recommendations to the Undergraduate Student Task Force for Student Success.  This informative and interactive session looks at the retention and academic performance data we reviewed and we want to solicit feedback from the audience to discuss suggestions to retain our male students of color.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
