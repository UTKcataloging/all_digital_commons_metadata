</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;February is celebrated nationally  as Black History Month. Unfortunately I submit to you that celebration has diminished significantly over the years.  The African American community faces an ongoing challenge of preserving identity and culture while at the same time seeking full integration into mass media. The continued influence and explosion of Hip hop in main stream media has added to the debate.  What has happened to our traditions?  Who controls our image? Who are we? what is needed versus what sells?  Or perhaps the question of the hour is who are we now?  Are we progressing or regressing?  This lively presentation and group discussion will raise the level of consciousness among our students of color at UT.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
