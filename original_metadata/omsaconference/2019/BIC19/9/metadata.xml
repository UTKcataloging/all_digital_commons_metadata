This presentation will consist of a brief overview of contributing factors and then move into a time of discussion among participants on what type of response is needed during and after these situations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

<value>&lt;p&gt;I just returned from Prague on a trip with Mustafa Ali-Smith. I began to talk with him about this topic and he asked if I could possibly submit to lead a discussion on this topic for the conference. I am still putting it together and do not have a file as of yet, but wanted to submit before the time was up. Please let me know if you have any questions. &lt;/p&gt;</value>
