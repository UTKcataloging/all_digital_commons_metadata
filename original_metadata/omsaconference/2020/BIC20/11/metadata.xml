</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Identity crisis plagued my psychological and physical experience when I was raised in Fall River, MA and Wilson, NC. Labels gained significance as I attempted to understand religion, policy, poverty, violence, and race in my household. I learned to believe in a white Jesus, but to fear the white man as well as my fellow black brothers. I was conflicted by the power of labels, and the role my black inferiority played in this world dominated by manmade labels. All labels come from finite beings who tend to inject their opinions and beliefs from a fear-based position. This perspective tends to skew the meaning of labels, to subjectively teach labels from a superior and inferior stance (e.g., whites are smarter than blacks and blacks are more athletic than whites). I had to redefine my purpose by questioning everything I ever learned and by rejecting everything that defined me up to that point. This new birth and new narrative provided me with a limitless power that ascended me higher than the limitations of what I defined blackness.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

&lt;li&gt;Participants will understand the intersectionality among blacks from different households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants will understand how being black served as something negative in my world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants will learn the role that policy, religion, and domestication played in limiting my power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participants will use this information to redefine blackness and to become limitless in the process.&lt;/li&gt;

<value>&lt;p&gt;My talk is training people to see beyond the limiting belief of color, by inspiring  my participants to tap into their inner spirit for limitless power. I will urge people to walk with a unifying faith and not by dividing sight. &lt;/p&gt;</value>
