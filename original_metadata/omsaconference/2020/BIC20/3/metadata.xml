</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Forbes recently highlighted a new study by LeanIn.Org and McKinsey &amp; Co. which paints a troubling picture about the treatment of black women in the workplace. According to the Women in The Workplace 2018 survey, &quot;women of color are not only significantly underrepresented, they are far less likely than others to be promoted to manager, more likely to face everyday discrimination and less likely to receive support from their managers.&quot; This workshop will provide insights, resources and hands on exercises to help black talent create a strategic leadership development plan around their career brand in order to advance despite barriers in their career.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
