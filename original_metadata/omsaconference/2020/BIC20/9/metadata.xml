</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many women aspire to be leaders. Women in general, and black women in particular are frequently faced with addressing systemic barriers and obstacles as they pursue leadership opportunities. Difficult conversations related to gender equity, gender fairness, and historical causes of underrepresentation in leadership positions are the norm. It is important to cultivate deeper relationships and interactions with each other while dealing with these issues as we provide a platform for those who share a common interest in increasing the number and skills of female leaders in their fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workshop will focus on aspects of authentic leadership and explore ways to support and empower black women to excel personally and professionally. Practical tips, tools, and strategies will be provided as Dr. Samuel encourages participants to be their best self in their field, on campus, at work, and in the community. The workshop will encourage professional development and address mentoring as a mechanism to identify and achieve personal, educational, and professional aspirations. At a time when we have up to five generations in the workforce, it is critical to help women at all stages understand the ART of advancement and success.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
