<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Abstract:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and what does it have to do with hope, health, and healing? ACEs have become a critical variable when looking at health outcomes because ACE scores can impact everything from physical health to mental health to substance misuse/use disorders. Community members and leaders equipped with a better understanding of ACEs, the conditions that reduce ACEs, and strategies to build resilience can have a greater impact through policy, advocacy, and improvements in services, resources, and programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) study is not new, however professionals in a multitude of disciplines are becoming more aware of how ACEs impact society at large. While individuals may have an awareness of adverse childhood experiences itself, many may not understand what the implications are for the results of the study. ACEs impact two-thirds of the population regardless of race, socioeconomic status, gender, ability, sexual orientation, etc. Furthermore, research indicates that individuals from marginalized populations may experience more Adverse Childhood Experiences than others. The purpose of Adverse Childhood Experiences: Why does it matter? is to examine the findings of the initial and subsequent ACEs studies, the impact specifically on the Black community, and the implications for policy and practice moving into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research consistently shows a strong correlation between ACEs and mental and physical health outcomes, substance use, and reduced educational attainment. The findings of ACE studies can greatly impact how we provide services to individuals and communities in the area of health and mental health services as well as policies that could possibly address the disproportionate exposure to ACEs within Black communities. Additionally, research shows that building resiliency can act as a protective factor that can mitigate the long-term impacts associated with ACEs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Social Ecological Model framework of public health, this program will also present a multilevel approach to address ACEs. Evidence-based practices will be presented and discussion around how we can support the creation of resilient communities focused on thriving and not just surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hope is that individuals who attend Adverse Childhood Experiences: Why does it matter? will leave the session with a better understanding of ACEs, how it affects their current role, and where to move toward the future.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
