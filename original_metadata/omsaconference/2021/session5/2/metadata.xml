</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Who could have known that 2020 would wreak so much havoc on America? From COVID to the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and countless others, black communities are plagued with health disparities; systemic racism; discrimination; violence and death by law enforcement as they go about their day-to-day lives. This workshop will focus on ways to support, encourage, and empower black students, faculty, staff, and community members to excel personally and professionally. As we continue to experience a myriad of issues related to COVID and social injustice, including but not limited to the loss of loved ones, loss of monumental milestones such as graduations and weddings, the loss of income and other resources, while at the same time dealing with social justice issues and political unrest it is imperative that we focus on our physical, mental health, and overall well-being. Practical tips, tools, and strategies will be provided as Dr. Samuel encourages participants to be their best self by maintaining an active lifestyle, engaging in important relationship while being socially distanced and isolated; staying in a positive headspace; and mastering things that are important to you.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
