</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the historic march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously paraphrased abolitionist and Unitarian minister, Theodore Parker, stating, “...the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.&quot; &lt;a title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The implication of the phrase is that the social justice goals of the Civils Rights Movement would eventually be achieved. His prayer was that servants of justice would be rewarded in due time. In other words, that the goals of Civil Rights Movement would be achievable in the future. President Obama resurrected the phrase throughout his presidential campaign and throughout his presidency. President Obama was so taken with the phrase that he even had the quote woven into the presidential rug in the Oval Office during his tenure in the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 with the Civil Rights movement in the rear view, the sentiment of the quote seem less prophetic and almost mocking in their promise and optimism. 2018 marks the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. King.on April 4, 1968, a date which marks the effective end to the Civil Rights Movement. While Dr. King’s life has been rightfully celebrated in the latter half of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;century, the reflection focuses mainly on his achievements and his legacy, not on his death or the efficacy of the Movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been 50 years since Dr. King has been assassinated and in many ways it does not necessarily seem as though much has changed. Racial disparities persist, despite the passage of civil rights legislation. America has not become the place described in Dr. King’s dream. There exists still the centuries long crisis about the way black lives have been treated in this country since before its founding. Despite eight years of a Black presidency in Barack Obama, recent events and political rhetoric makes it seem as though we are on a continuum that is not sloping upward. Black people, workers, people of color are still asking to be seen and they are still demanding justice and equality. The current protests and demonstrations and political arguments occurring today seem like repeated occurrences from 1968. The years 1968 and 2018 feel eerily similar.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
