</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Although the inadmissibility of polygraph evidence in the course of a criminal trial has been well-established law in Tennessee for almost fifty years, the quandary presented itself two years ago in State v. Pierce.&#39; This case forced the Tennessee Supreme Court to balance the need to protect state citizens against sexual predators with the wellestablished rules of evidence which hold that &quot;polygraph evidence is inherently unreliable, and therefore irrelevant and inadmissible. &#39; In Pierce, the issue before the court was whether polygraph test results, which were performed as part of a sex offender risk assessment and encouraged by leading psychosexual analysts and researchers, were admissible in the non-capital sentencing hearing of a convicted sex offender.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
