</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The goal of fact-based death penalty research is, simply put, to capture and document as many facts surrounding legal executions as possible, organize them in a clear and logical manner, and present them without bias, cant, or sentiment. This compilation of facts is then made available for an analysis of whether patterns appear suggesting which facts were and possibly still remain the leading factors influencing legal death. The focus of fact-based research is clear and orderly facts. Indeed, publications that grow out of fact-based death penalty research document executions in chronological order, and each entry includes the executed person&#39;s name, age, gender, race, a detailed account in narrative form of the crime for which the accused was sentenced to death, and information on the place and method of execution. Regardless of the legal issue, the first place to begin death penalty research is with a list of those known to have suffered irrevocable punishment.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
