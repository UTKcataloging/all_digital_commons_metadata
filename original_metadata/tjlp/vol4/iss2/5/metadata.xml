</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This paper will examine the ecological status and prospects of Panama&#39;s reverted areas, meaning those areas returned to the country with the reversion of sovereignty over the Panama Canal lands. Following an introductory Part I that highlights Panama&#39;s biological diversity, Part II will isolate some of the development pressures facing the reverted areas and those closest to central Panama City in particular. In addition, Part II will describe the extent of the reverted areas and identify their biological, environmental, social and economic value both to Panama City and the Republic. Part III will discuss the importance of protecting the reverted areas in light of global accords on biodiversity and tropical forest protection. Part III will additionally consider existing legal protections under Panamanian law and identify other examples of the legal protection of protected areas and biodiversity in the region by suggesting ways in which the Panamanian legal protections might be strengthened. Finally, Part IV will consider the prospects for successful protection of the reverted areas and will conclude with justifications and recommendations for a successful strategy to ensure the long-term viability of the reverted areas as protected areas and biodiversity havens.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>

<value>Professor of Law and Co-Director, Center for the Comparative Study of Metropolitan Growth, Georgia State University College of Law. Thanks to Deans Steve Kaminshine and William Prigge for their support of the Study Space project, to Dr. Daniel Suman for lending his energy, expertise, organizational skills and encyclopedic knowledge of Panama to help make this inaugural Study Space possible, and to Stevie Phillips, Editor of the TENNESSEE JOURNAL OF LAW AND POLICY, for her receptiveness to undertake publication of this first set of Study Space research papers, and to her successor, Ashley Musselman and this article&#39;s editor, Chris Hayden, for their patience and assistance. Scholars, activists, and government officials in Panama were exceptionally generous with their time, energy, and knowledge. I hope some of what we learned from them is reflected in these pages. Jad Atallah, Georgia State College of Law Class of 2008, and Georgia State College of Law Librarian Michael Davis provided essential research assistance for which I am grateful. Daniel Suman and Jacqueline Howard both provided useful comments that made this paper a better one, but are not responsible for any of its faults.</value>
