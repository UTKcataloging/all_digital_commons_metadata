</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Luis Lebron is a thirty-five year old who balances his duties as sole caretaker of his four year-old son with pursuing a degree at the University of Central Florida.&#39; To help support himself and his child while in school, Lebron applied to the Florida Department of Children and Families for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefits in July 2011. However, Lebron refused to take the drug test&quot; required by a recently passed Florida statute, requiring prospective TANF beneficiaries to undergo drug testing prior to receiving benefits. Lebron insists that he has never used illegal drugs, but refuses to take the test claiming that requiring him to pay for drug testing when there is no reason to suspect him of drug use is unreasonable and a violation of his Fourth Amendment right.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
