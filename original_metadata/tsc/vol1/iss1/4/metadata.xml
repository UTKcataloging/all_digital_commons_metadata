</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Addressing problems of professional competency (PPC) among doctoral students is essential given that doctoral students will become our future counselor educators. In this study, doctoral students (N = 345) in CACREP-accredited programs were surveyed about their knowledge of peers’ PPC. The findings of this study indicate doctoral students are aware of peers with PPC (68.1%), which include inadequate skills to deliver counseling services as well as problematic behaviors related to personal or psychological issues. Findings suggest respondents are affected negatively by being in a program with a peer they perceive has a PPC (47.9%) and are frustrated with educators for allowing problematic peers to continue their doctoral training (70%). The findings of this study show that faculty members need to place more emphasis on educating doctoral students about competency issues and assessing for PPC.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
