</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the current issue of &lt;em&gt;Accolades&lt;/em&gt; you will learn of the very important work our students are engaged in as they counsel youth who are suffering loss. The Grief Outreach Center, under the direction of Tricia McClam, is providing grief counseling to elementary through high school students who have lost close family members, are struggling as a result of separation or divorce, or dealing with other personal tragedy. Denise Bates and Allison Anders are leading the effort to assist in the resettlement of refugees from the African country of Burundi. Special attention is being focused on the successful transition and assimilation of the Burundian children into the local school system. Once again, under the direction of these outstanding faculty, students in the college are acquiring important experience for addressing the needs of these new members of our community.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
