</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Behind the unflagging spirit of SIS there are three themes that resonate throughout this issue of Interface. First, the School continues to be client-centric and is working hard to reach out to all of its constituencies—the students, the alumni and to its many friends and partners. Second, we have become more focused setting priorities and aligning our resources to achieve our goals and outperform as never before in research, teaching and service. And third, how we look is part of who we are—professional, innovative, and successful. You will discover these themes as you read about personnel changes that have occurred since last fall, our renovation projects, faculty awards and achievements, staff news, student activities and projects, alumni affairs and the School’s governance and administration.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
