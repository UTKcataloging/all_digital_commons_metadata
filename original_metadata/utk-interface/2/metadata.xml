</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Academic 2001-2002 has just ended, so it seems a good time to recap some of the events of this year for our alumni. Importantly, our accreditation program presentation and visit went well, and we are grateful for all the support from you. Nearly 100 people joined the faculty and staff for the reception and briefing on April 7, and the external review panel seemed pleased to be able to visit with so many constituents of our program. You can still review the program presentation on the Web at http://www.sis.utk.edu/ admin/coa/index.htm, and there is a wealth of information about the School in the linked documents. We won&#39;t hear from the ALA Committee on Accreditation until late June or early July but we will get the word out on the outcome of the accreditation review in the next issue of Interface.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
