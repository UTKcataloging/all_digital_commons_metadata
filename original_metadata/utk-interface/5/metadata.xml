</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The last few months have been busy ones for SIS. Since the first of the year, we’ve experienced an Academic Program Review, searched for a new faculty member, participated in a search for a permanent Dean of the College of Communication and Information, and, through the generous assistance of the Institute for Scientific Information’s (ISI) Corporate Awards Program, we cosponsored a lecture by Dr. Michael Buckland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should have a new College dean in place when you read the next Interface. Four excellent candidates came to campus for two-day interviews that involved faculty, staff and students from every unit in the College. This effort represents yet another step toward the full integration of SIS into the College, as well as a step forward in the creation of a new identity for the College.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
