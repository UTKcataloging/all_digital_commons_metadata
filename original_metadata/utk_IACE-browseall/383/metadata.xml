</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This capsule on the International History and Philosophy of Andragogy is mainly limited (with a few exceptions) to a chronological history and the accompanying philosophy of andragogy, in line with when the English language documents were published and personal descriptions of events were written down. Some of these documents, however, presents aspect of the events and ideas which recount the years and contexts prior to the time in which they appeared in published form. To date, more than 330 documents have been discovered, but space limitation in this chapter allowed the inclusion of only a fraction of that number. Each of 14 time periods are articulated with selected works.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
