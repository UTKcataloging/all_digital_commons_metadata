</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This chapter provides various materials and described events the author has personally found helpful in threading together elements of adult and community health education and learning that his vibrant health and length of life thus far at age 82. His understanding was that these writers cited did not focus on health. Rather, the author used the materials for helping him develop and maintain a long, healthy life. Many Bible passages are included because the author views them as the Word of God, which has helped him learn to live long and healthily. His beliefs, attitudes, values, and stages of life are all central to his perspective on health. Although he provides his personal story about learning to live long and healthy, he suggests that each reader consider developing and applying her/his own view of learning to live long and healthy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
