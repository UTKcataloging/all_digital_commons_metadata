</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Providing an overview of Brazilian Education is a task that could take volumes to present. Moreover, to do this in a comprehensive way would involve many Brazilians that have been involved with the Brazilian Educational System for many years. There are many facets that would be included in this country&#39;s rich history and present manifestation of education and learning. Nonetheless, as a visitor from the United States of America who has been privileged to visit Brazil eight times and conduct various lifelong learning education al programs there, I will attempt in this paper to offer some of my observations about Lifelong Education and Learning in Brazil. My eighth trip to Brazil for this purpose has been an enriching experience and one that has rewarded me with tremendously beneficial learning over a period of 25 years, beginning in 1985 up until the present year of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
