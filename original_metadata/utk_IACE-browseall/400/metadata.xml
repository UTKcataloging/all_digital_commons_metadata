Kennedy, who in 1963 launched the Alliance for Progress, a program of government-to-government economic cooperation across the Western Hemisphere. At the same time, Kennedy also called for a parallel people-to-people initiative, one that would allow private citizens to work together for the good of the Americas. Today, it is a private, nonprofit, and nonpartisan organization, enjoying the support of many individuals, international corporations, and foundations. Every US president since Kennedy has endorsed the Partners&#39; program, as have government leaders throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. There are 60 &#39;partnerships&#39; that have been permanently established between 45 states and the District of Columbia in the USA, and 31 Latin American and Caribbean countries. The relationship between Missouri had Para is now in its 43rd year. The main program areas include: Citizen participation, education and training, economic development, family life, and culture. People volunteer their participation from all walks of life, including: doctors, nurses, social workers, religious leaders, farmers, foresters, artists, city administrators, university professors, engineers, students in high school and higher education, and leaders of numerous community organizations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
