</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Andragogy has received various mixed reviews in the past. Some have analyzed it from a positive perspective. Others have analyzed it from a negative perspective, still others have viewed it from a neutral or passive point of view while some have ignored it altogether. Most of the discussions have limited their observations to how Malcolm S. Knowles addressed andragogy. There has been an inadequate investigation of the foundation and background of andragogy from a world perspective. This research presents more than 450 major works published in English from national and international sources on andragogy that may help provide a clear and understandable international foundation for the linkage between the research, theory, and practice of andragogy. Six major themes have emerged that provide a foundation for the linkage: The evolution of the term; historical antecedents shaping the concept; comparison of American and European understandings; popularizing and sustaining the American and world-wide concept; practical applications; and theory, research, and definition. This is a 2015 June update of an ongoing research on the major themes in andragogy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
