</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This updated History and Philosophy of Andragogy is mainly limited [with a few exceptions] to a chronological history and the accompanying philosophy of andragogy, in lines with when the English language documents were published and the personal descriptions of events were recorded. Some of these documents, however, presents aspects of events and ideas which recount the years and context prior to the time in which they appeared in published form. To date, nearly 400 documents have been discovered, but space limitation in this paper allowed the inclusion of only a fraction of that number. Each of 15 time periods is articulated with selected works and the important new developments are found mostly in the most recent era.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
