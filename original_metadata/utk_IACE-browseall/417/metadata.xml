</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents some of the benefits of using learning contracts by some in the USA who have used them for many years, and others in Italy who had never used them, but were beginning to experiment with using them. Illustrations of results were provided by colleagues from both countries, comparisons were made between the two, and lessons learned from the experience were shared. There is a very different perspective between using them over a long period of time and just beginning to use them. However, the keenest insight is that they are beneficial at each stage along the way, but in different ways. It is important to acknowledge the benefits of each stage of growth and the long range positive results that accrue in the overall process.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
