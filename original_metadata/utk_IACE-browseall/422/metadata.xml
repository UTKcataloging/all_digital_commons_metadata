</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study uses a prospective qualitative approach. The Ethnographic Delphi Futures Research (EDFR) technique is used to propose a learning society model. The data include a review of the peer-reviewed literature, a field study visit and observation of five best practices communities in Thailand, in-depth interviews to gain expertsâ€™ perspectives, mini-Delphi techniques questionnaires, focus group discussions, and model evaluation. Qualitative data were transcribed and analyzed using content-analysis. Forty-two individuals (e.g., policy makers, practitioners from public and private agencies, educational personnel, and community leaders) were involved in the data collection effort. Results revealed essential elements for development of a learning society including components, principles, developmental processes, strategies, and key success factors to enhance a positive paradigm shift for communities. It is anticipated that the findings will (1) add meaningful information and practical guidelines for developing a learning society, (2) contribute to ensuring the quality of citizen participation and ensure balanced and sustainable development of communities and societies, as well as (3) serve as a basis for further research.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
