</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This paper on the history and philosophy of andragogy is mainly limited (with a few exceptions) to a chronological history and accompanying philosophy of andragogy, in line with when the English language documents were published and personal descriptions of events were written down. Some of these documents, however, present aspect of the events and ideas which recount the years and context in which they appeared in published form. This will not be an exact history of the events and philosophy as they appeared in chronological order. But, this will be presented in the general sequence of the years that the articles, books, commentaries, and any other publication forms were recorded or appeared in and/or were published.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
