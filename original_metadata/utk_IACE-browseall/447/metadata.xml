</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Formal adult teacher model mentoring programs tend to have a predictable set of elements: policies, mentor selection procedures, mentor training activities, mentor role expectations, mentor-adult teacher matching, and secondary development relationships. Mentoring is an individualized, long-term, teaching/learning relationship between two people used to accomplish a variety of purposes. Yet, little evaluation has been conducted to determine its results, or the effectiveness of the current process, with an eye to making program improvements. The purpose of this qualitative research study was to: develop a program improvement model for an adult teacher mentoring program; apply the model to a formal adult teacher mentoring program; perform a meta evaluation of the model and implementation; and, recommend changes to the model. A case study design was used to accomplish the purpose. Three data sources included individual and group interviews, and 1988 to 1993 historical program documentation. A purposeful sampling strategy was used to select nineteen interviewees from a possible forty-two. The model included defining evaluative questions, data collection, data analysis and interpretation, and reporting, an experienced metaevaluator addressed the model&#39;s trustworthiness. Findings confirmed little program accountability, site condition adaptations, model authenticity, and added to the model, identifying stakeholders and decision makers, and re-planning and redesign.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
