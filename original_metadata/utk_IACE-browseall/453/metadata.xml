</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;There is a high degree of educational need in a correctional setting. In one states, 60% of the total number incarcerated are unable to read and write. The increase of that population is of some concern. In 1925, state and federal prisons held 79 people per one-hundred thousand inmates, and in 1985 the number had risen to 201 per one-hundred thousand. If adult education has as one of its goals a contribution toward enhancing the quality of individual lives and society in general, then the way in which correctional residents are taught is important. During the 1989 winter semester, a three semester hour credit course was conducted with residents of the Missouri Eastern Correctional Center to train tutors of adult literacy. Participatory adult training techniques were employed extensively. The students were nearing the completion of a Bachelor&#39;s Degree program provided by the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The intent of the penal system in providing this course was that the resident/students could give back something to the society that had provided the opportunity to improve their lives. Further research is needed to help guide future direction of this course within the degree program. Questions could include: Should this approach be extended to other courses in the program? Will this teaching/learning approach help residents overcome recidivism now and when they are released?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
