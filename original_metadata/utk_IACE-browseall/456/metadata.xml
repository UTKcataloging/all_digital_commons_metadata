</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The expensive growth of adult and continuing education has brought with it many teachers who have subject matter expertise, but have no background, training or experience in teaching adults. While there are many of these people who are naturally successful in teaching adults, others may need assistance in becoming equipped for effective teaching in an adult learning setting. Attention is given to some adult education literature which implies, without directly stating, that research on the value of the training needs to emerge out of the model of practice. This research issue paper sets forth a new five-step theoretical model of training practice which could be implemented for preparing non-experienced teachers of adults. The model includes: beliefs and notions about adult learners; perceptions concerning qualities of effective teachers; phases and sequences of the learning process; teaching tips and learning techniques; and, implementing the prepared plan. It is proposed that this model of training practice be a grounding source for generating needs for research on the relative effectiveness of training and preparing non-experienced teachers of adults. The foregoing would obviously help create a bridge or at least help clarify how one bridge could be built between theory and practice of teaching adults. In addition, it may provide a closer link between some of the researchers and practitioners in the whole enterprise of helping adults learn.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
