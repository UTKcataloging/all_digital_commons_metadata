</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This 2014 updated History and Philosophy of Andragogy includes 10 new items and is mainly limited [with a few reception] to a chronological history and the accompanying philosophy of andragogy, in line with when the English language documents were published and personal description of events were recorded. Some of these documents, however, present aspects of events and ideas which recount the years and contexts prior to the time in which they appeared in published form. To date, nearly 400 documents have been discovered, but space limitation in this paper allowed the inclusion of only a fraction of that number. Each of 15 eras is articulated with selected works and the important new development are found mostly in the most recent era.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
