</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This paper on the History and Philosophy of Andragogy includes items related to andragogy, especially as they apply to adult basic and literacy learners as well as the instructors and educators that facilitate the learning of these adults. Many of these documents as well as the accompanying experience of the author have been discovered and accumulated over a period of 16 years. While this article contains only 70 documents, there are now more than 500 documents covering wider and more extensive andragogical research. These particular documents, though limited to the English, are arranged chronologically and have been obtained from the Internet. The author began his privileged journey into adult education in 1984 and has since travelled to 20 countries to work with adult educators.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
