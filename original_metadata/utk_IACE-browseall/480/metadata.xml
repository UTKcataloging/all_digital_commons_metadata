</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Much has been written about the older adult and learning. A large number of such writings have focused on the premise that learning needs and capabilities decline with age. However, recent research and discussion have been. centered around a changing theme: declines in learning abilities and interest may be considerably less than has been historically thought. In fact, there is some evidence now available that shows older adult learners outstripping younger learners in certain areas of endeavor. The purpose of the research presented in this report was to obtain an even greater understanding of the older learner. Consequently, learning interests, obstacles, and actual activities were examined by interviewing 256 older adults in the State of Nebraska utilizing the learning projects protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
