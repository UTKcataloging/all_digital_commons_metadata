</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Health and well being in animals cannot be achieved by use of vaccines and feed additives alone. Healthy horses are fed well and kept in facilities in good repair. They are seen by their caregivers often, and small problems are not allowed to become big ones. Healthy horses also receive animal health products that have been properly stored and are used according to label directions. The three most frequent veterinary complaints in horses are colic, lacerations and lameness. Special attention should be paid to preventing these problems. Horse health care need not be expensive but does need to be comprehensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease control in horses is effective only when several general areas of disease control are implemented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
