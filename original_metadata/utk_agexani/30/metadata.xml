</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Weaning is stressful on both the mare and foal. Many times horse producers wean foals with little regard to the emotional and physical stress that often arises. They typically wean their foals based on tradition or mere convenience. However, in todayâ€™s highly productive horse operations, many considerations are given to the weaning process that will have a positive influence on the health and general well-being of the mare and foal. This fact sheet will assist the horse owner in developing a weaning management program. Some of the weaning management considerations include: keeping stress level to a minimum, creep feeding, adequate health program, age at weaning, weaning system and concerns for the mare. Weaning should encourage maximum health of the mare as well as optimum growth and positive mental attitude of the foal.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
