</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Everyone agrees it is important to protect children and childcare workers from needless contact with products used to manage pests. It is equally as important to make sure children and workers are not harmed or made sick by coming in contact with pests. For example, many people do not know that cockroaches can make people sick. German cockroaches are the most common pests in kitchens. They, along with flies and other pests, can spread germs that can cause food poisoning. Cockroaches can even cause someone with asthma to have an attack. Mosquitoes, ticks, rodents and birds can transfer organisms that cause certain diseases, such as West Nile Virus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, hantavirus and others. And, most pests are just a nuisance.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
