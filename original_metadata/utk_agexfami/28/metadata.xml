<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it amazing how fast your toddler is learning new words? Language learning may be your child’s most important accomplishment this year. You are helping. Every time you sing her a song, read her a story or repeat a nursery rhyme, your toddler learns about language and learns that you enjoy language. Remember, your child learns by imitating you and by catching your enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their eagerness to teach their little ones about language, some parents forget that language goes two ways. Children must hear people use language, but they also need adults to listen and respond to their words. Let your little one tell you stories, “read” books to you, describe things she has seen and answer your questions. Help her make up songs; encourage her to play at rhyming words or making up new words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show your child that what she says is important to you. Remember, communication means talking and listening.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
