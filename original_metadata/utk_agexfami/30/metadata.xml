<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Children love to learn about themselves and their past. It helps them to feel important and special. A very nice thing you can do for your child and yourselves is to collect and organize reminders of these early years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances are you have some memory makings already. You can use photographs, birthday cards, certificates and so forth to start a memory book or a memory box. Add pictures your child draws, a piece of her favorite blanket, an outline of her hand or footprint, her holiday cards, newspapers published on her birthdays, notes from favorite relativesâ€” and anything else you and she want to save. Let your child know this is a special book you want to keep for both of you. Let her look at it only with you so you can keep it from getting torn and dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too soon, these early years pass. A memory book will help you and your child enjoy remembering these special years.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
