</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;All trees have their good and bad characteristics.  Rarely does a tree throughout its lifetime satisfy or even maintain the objectives for which it was planted. Trees become larger over time, often outgrowing their original growing space both above and below the ground.  Some trees also droduct fruits or seeds that may be troublesome to the homeowner.  An example of a tree planted to fulfill a need, but later presenting problems is silver maple, which grows and provides shade quickly.  However, it is a short-lived tree with brittle wood prone to limb breakage during wind and ice storms.  Another example is sweetgum, which is a handsome tree with attractive foliage, but its root sprouts and the seed capsules (sweetgum balls) can create a nuisance.  Outlined below are a few trees with their associated problems that homeowners should consider before planting.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
