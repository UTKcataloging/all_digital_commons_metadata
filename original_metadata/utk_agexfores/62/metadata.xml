</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;It’s a common sight in developments that are 3 – 5 years old. A homeowner had initially purchased a property for its wooded and natural aesthetic appeal and thinks he or she has succeeded in preserving this beauty. When the home is finished and the nearby trees still cast shade, the owner considers the trees to be past the critical stage. It isn’t until after the interior is furnished and the lawn is established that the homeowner soon notices he or she is picking up a few more fallen branches in the yard than is customary. Eventually, the owner looks up and sees the tree in serious decline (usually dieback along the ends of the branches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a professional in the housing or construction field, you can have a major impact on how site-sensitive your company is perceived to be by the practices you employ. Preserving existing vegetation does indeed take time and thought, but it can also increase your profit. “Trees are aesthetically pleasing and are well known to increase real estate values by as much as 15 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
