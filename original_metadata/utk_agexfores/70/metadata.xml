</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Snow, ice, wind, hail and even heavy rain can cause significant damage to residential trees. Understanding the impacts of storms on trees will allow you to develop both preventative measures to decrease the probability of tree damage and management approaches to care for trees after damage has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees may be uprooted, decapitated or suffer massive crown loss as branches are broken by the force of the wind or by the weight of ice and snow. Loss of large portions of the crown results in tree stress, a reduction of growth and entry sites for insects and disease. Depending on the degree of damage, some trees will recover on their own, others need immediate care to repair the damage incurred and some are so irreversibly damaged that they will eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
