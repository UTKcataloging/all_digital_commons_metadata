<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Water makes up approximately twothirds of the body’s weight and approximately 75 percent of the brain’s weight. Nearly 4 percent of the water in the body is lost through the skin, lungs and through urine and stools each day. This water loss must be replaced continually by beverage and food consumption. Sweating causes greater water loss and increases the need to consume more fluids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water loss resulting in as little as 1 percent decrease in body weight is called dehydration. Dehydration will reduce the body’s ability to perform physically and mentally. Infants and children can quickly become dehydrated; therefore, it is critical they consume adequate fluids. Water is so important to well-being that you can only live a few days without it.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
