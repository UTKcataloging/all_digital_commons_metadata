<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This workshop was designed to focus on how environmental factors influence a&lt;br /&gt;communitiesâ€™ nutrition and physical activity habits. During the morning session, nationally&lt;br /&gt;renowned experts in the fields of nutrition, active transportation, public health, and urban&lt;br /&gt;planning delivered keynote presentations and held a panel discussion. In the afternoon,&lt;br /&gt;the audience members split into breakout sessions facilitated by the conference organizers,&lt;br /&gt;and solutions to the problems presented by the experts were sought and recorded. Finally,&lt;br /&gt;at the conclusion of the conference, a panel discussion of policy-makers (including&lt;br /&gt;both elected and appointed officials) provided a thoughtful reflection on the process of&lt;br /&gt;implementing change through influencing the legislative process and enacting policies.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
