<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of two and a half years, Thomas Carpenter has worked with the Students Government Association, the University of Tennessee administration, the Knoxville and UT Police Departments, and the members of the Tennessee State legislature to implement a Medical Amnesty/ Good Samaritan policy for students at UT and for the entire state. A Medical Amnesty policy allows those intoxicated by drugs or alcohol and any bystanders to seek necessary medical attention during an emergency without fear of repercussions. A Medical Amnesty clause was added to the proposed Student Code of Conduct, which protects students from academic penalties, and there have been multiple pieces of legislation introduced to the State House and Senate to extend similar protections, including legal protection, to all students and citizens of the State of Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
