<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study was conducted to find out the prevalence of Aleutian disease (AD) among ranch mink herds in Canada with an objective of implementing an effective control programme versus this disease. Estimate on the (AD) prevalence was achieved by conducting survey on herds per province. In order to generate current, accurate national results from accredited laboratory facilities, the CMBA Aleutian disease task force requested each Canadian rancher to submit 200 blood samples from breeder animals for a no cost counter immunoelectrophoresis testing at one of the three designated laboratories in Canada. The submission rate was 47/238 (20%). A survey collecting associated ranch information (ranch size, feed delivery, colour phase raised, whelp average, and illness or reproductive problems). was returned at a rate of 61/238 (26%). The mean prevalence of AD at a national level was approximately 5%. The only variables with significant statistical association of AD (P&lt;0.01) were ranchers ability to detect signs of AD when it was present on a ranch having AD on the ranch within the previous three years and having high mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
