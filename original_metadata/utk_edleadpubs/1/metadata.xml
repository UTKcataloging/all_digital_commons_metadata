</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this survey research study was to examine Tennessee community college student decisions and experiences with print and digital course material formats. Analysis considered which format students prefer between print or digital, the reasons behind those preferences, and whether those preferences significantly differed based upon demographic characteristics, perceived levels of technological savviness, and/or the availability of home internet access. Students enrolled for the fall 2019 semester at community colleges across the Tennessee Board of Regents system were surveyed using both open-and closed-ended questions (n = 1,912). Results showed that most students (63.6%) preferred to use print materials, with no significant connections based on demographic characteristics (non-White, low income, age) or home internet access. Student voices woven throughout provided an additional layer of insight for educational leaders seeking to establish policies and practices that optimize the student experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
