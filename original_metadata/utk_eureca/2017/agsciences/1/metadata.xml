</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Histomonas meleagridis is a protozoan parasite of avians and is the causative agent in Histomonosis, commonly known as Blackhead Disease. Current methods for diagnosing the presence of H. meleagridis are limited to parasite culture or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to amplify target DNA. This project aims to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for faster and more sensitive diagnosis of Histomonas infections. Cultures of H. meleagridis parasites were purified, and surface antigens were extracted using a spectrum of chemical solutions. The various antigen solutions were subjected to an ELISA, with serum from birds immunized for H. meleagridis as positive controls. The ELISA was measured for absorbency differences between positive and negative control serum samples. Preliminary results indicate Propanol as a promising treatment; however conclusive data necessitates additional ELISA analysis. Histomonosis threatens the health of both wild and domestic bird populations. Control of this disease relies on quality management and diagnostic techniques. This ELISA will aid scientist, managers, and veterinarians in the study and eventual control of this disease, and also allow researchers the opportunity to understand the impact of Histomonas outbreaks and elucidate the attack rate of the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
