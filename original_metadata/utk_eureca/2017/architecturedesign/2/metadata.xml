</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;A windowless façade becomes the inspiration for an experimentation of materials. Through the use of terracotta cladding, Mario Botta crafts a local landmark and structural masterpiece in his design of the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art. The Bechtler Museum is located in Charlotte, North Carolina, and appears as a giant terracotta-red cube in the downtown cityscape. Instead of including several exterior windows, Botta focuses on the materiality of terracotta to function as an attractive facade and as an effective enclosure system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research project analyzes structural and enclosure elements of Mario Botta’s Bechtler Museum. Through diagramming the building in section, elevation, and axonometric form, this analysis documents the hidden components used to construct the museum. This analysis also chooses to focus on the exterior façade, because of its programmatic relationship to the museum as an exhibition space. By contrasting the skylights with the opaque façade, the Bechtler Museum presents a dichotomy of lighting conditions used to protect and display artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is also as much about architectural drawing as it is about the design of the Bechtler Museum. By detailing structural and enclosure elements, this research analysis argues that understanding structure is best learned through diagramming and reinterpreting drawings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
