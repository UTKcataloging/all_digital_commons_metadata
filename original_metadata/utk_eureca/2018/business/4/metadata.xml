</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Free for the Fort is a delivery company designed for college students. We specialize in fast and efficient bicycle delivery of food and groceries to students within a two-mile radius of the campus. We collaborate with the University to create an online platform that allows students to utilize their university meal plan or their own money to pay for the order. We realized that there is a need for a delivery service specific to college students. Free for the Fort is a company that fills that gap by offering students the fastest and cheapest on-campus delivery right to their door. Currently, we are located at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. We have plans to expand to other campuses that have similar campus layouts as UTK.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
