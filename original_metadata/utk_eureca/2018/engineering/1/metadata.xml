However, as millions of hepatocytes inhabit a mouse liver and only some are infected, how T cells locate the infection site and eliminate infection remains poorly understood. Are T cells moving intentionally toward parasites, or randomly successful? To answer this, I used timed position data of malaria-specific T cells, non-specific control T cells, and a parasite, obtained from experiments in a mouse liver; I performed analyses with the null hypothesis that T cells move randomly. I used two metrics, based on distances from the parasite and turning angles. The tests performed with these metrics did not suggest the same conclusions. Investigating this inconsistency, I calculated the probability of a cell getting closer to the parasite as viewed from the distance metric, which turned out less than the assumed 50 percent. With this discovery, I improved the null hypothesis&#39; distribution. Applying this improvement to the original tests, the distance metric&#39;s test results more resembled the angle metric&#39;s. This development regarding the definition of random movement gets us one step closer to accurately analyzing cell position data and understanding T cell movement.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
