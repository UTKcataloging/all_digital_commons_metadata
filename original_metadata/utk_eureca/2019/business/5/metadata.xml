</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Yes, We Can! Brewing Company is a minority owned and operated small batch microbrewery for black women, by black women. The brewery aims to change the narrative of women of color in the craft beer industry by creating unparalleled quality beverages that empower this underserved market. Yes, We Can! is blazing the trail by paying homage to the original trailblazers, crafting beer as complex as the women on our labels. From Mae Jemison, the first African American female astronaut to travel to space to Bessie Coleman, the first African American woman to hold a pilot license, each can’s label will tell the story of black female achievement. It may seem like a small gesture but at Yes, We Can! we feel that in doing so, women of color will be more inclined and empowered to choose craft beer. While located in the historic neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant, the company plans to travel to be visible at events that purposefully and authentically uplift the black experience.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
