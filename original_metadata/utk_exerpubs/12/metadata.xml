</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In 1996, Dr. Paul Williams began The National Runnerâ€™s Health Study. The study had over one hundred thousand respondents who were questioned about their physical activity habits (walking or running), diet, weight, height, and use or previous use of tobacco and alcohol. Some of the participants were involved in case studies of several years. Primarily, the study tested the effects of vigorous physical activity and its ability to reduce disease.
