<abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current study collected occupational data from the 327 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I membership institutions head athletic directors.  The purpose of this study is to identify common background and occupational characteristics of NCAA Division I athletic directors.  Through issuing an electronic survey, the current study sought to identify common characteristics and themes among Division I athletic directors specifically within basic demographical information, educational background, professional experience and career progression, and career and job satisfaction.  The study also provides demographic background information about the participantâ€™s institutional athletic department. The necessity of this study is due directly to the current lack of current literature and research within the collegiate administration occupational field.  If successful, the current study will provide an occupational background to the NCAA Division I athletic director career field. The study also seeks to provide aspiring persons that wish to work in the field of collegiate athletic departments a common occupational framework for educational requirements, professional positions and departments and years necessary to gather the appropriate experience, and also identify an overview of the job and career satisfaction common among current NCAA Division I athletic directors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
