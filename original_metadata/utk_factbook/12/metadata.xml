</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The 2002-2003 edition of the University of Tennessee Fact Book comes with a new look, reflecting recent changes in the university&#39;s organizational structure. The University of Tennessee encompasses programs in Knoxville, Memphis, and Tullahoma, as well as the Institute of Agriculture, and the Institute for Public Service. These changes are incorporated in this edition of the Fact Book. For this reason, some of the data reported for 2002-2003 will vary substantially from previous years. For example, the number of professional degrees granted shows a marked increase because of the addition of the degrees awarded at the Health Science Center. The reader is advised to note the altered metric when extracting information from the Fact Book. Please contact the Office of Institutional Research and Assessment if you are seeking information arrayed differently than found in the Fact Book.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
