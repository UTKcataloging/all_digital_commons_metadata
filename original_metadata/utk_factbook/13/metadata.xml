</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The University of Tennessee Office of Institutional Research and Assessment is pleased to welcome you to its twelfth annual Fact Book. This year&#39;s edition has presented some special challenges as the university&#39;s reorganization continues, and is, in some ways, a transitional year for the Fact Book. Unless otherwise noted, tables in the Fact Book now also include data for the Institute of Agriculture and the Space Institute at Tullahoma. In this same vein, a brief section of the Health Science Center has been added acknowledging the new relationship of the Knoxville and Memphis campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing a volume as comprehensive as the Fact Book requires the work and cooperation of many people across the university. Many offices and individuals have contributed to this effort and I am grateful for their help. I would especially like to thank Elizabeth Pemberton, editor of the Fact Book, for her fine work in overseeing every stage of the production of this publication.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
