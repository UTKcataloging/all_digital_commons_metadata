</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the eleventh annual Fact Book of the University of Tennessee&#39;s Knoxville campus produced by the Office of Institutional Research and Assessment. This year&#39;s edition has been expanded to include a section reporting degrees awarded by discipline (see Appendix). As always, the goal is to make the Fact Book as useful as possible so your comments and suggestions are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effort as large as the production of the Fact Book requires the help and cooperation of numerous offices and individuals from within the university. I would like to thank the people who contributed to this effort. I also would like to acknowledge Elizabeth Pemberton, editor of the Fact Book, for her diligent and thorough work.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
