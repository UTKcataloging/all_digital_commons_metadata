This year&#39;s edition includes three new pages with data about enrollments by race and sex, and a fourth page about the 21st Century Campaign.

&lt;p&gt;I would like to acknowledge the many offices and individuals on the UTK campus who provide data for the Fact Book. Their help makes this truly a cooperative effort.
