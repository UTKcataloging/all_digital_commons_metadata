</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the eighth annual Fact Book of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. This year&#39;s edition has been graphically enhanced, and a new page presenting data about need-based financial aid has been added. The yearly production of the Fact Book serves as a culmination of the work conducted by the Office of Institutional Research and demonstrates the diversity of the data we use. It is a source of satisfaction to me that it has become a standard resource for the university community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to acknowledge the many offices and individuals on the UTK campus who provide data for the Fact Book. Their help makes this truly a cooperative effort. Within the Office of Institutional Research, almost every staff member makes a contribution to the editorial process. I would especially like to thank Nancy Waller for her untiring efforts as editor of the Fact Book.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
