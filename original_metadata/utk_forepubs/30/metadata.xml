<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The Asian longhorned tick (Haemophysalis longicorns Neumann; alternative names include Asian longhorned tick, Asian tick, bush tick, New Zealand cattle tick) is a species of hard tick in the family Ixodidae. It is native to eastern China, Japan, the Russian Far East and Korea. It has also established in Australia, New Zealand and several Pacific islands, where it is considered a severe exotic pest of livestock. In late 2017, the United States Department of Agricultureâ€™s National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed the presence of the Asian longhorned tick in the United States. These ticks were first identified in New Jersey, but have since been found in archival samples from West Virginia as far back as 2010. The origin of the tick in the US remains unknown. Some possible routes of entry include entering on domestic pets, horses, livestock or humans. The real impact of the introduction of this tick into the US is not clear at this time, but animal health officials are concerned about potential detrimental impacts on livestock and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
