</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;It has been found that non-magnetic organic semiconductors can show some magnetic responses in low magnetic field (&lt;100 &gt;mT). When applying magnetic field, the electroluminescence, electrical current, photocurrent, and photoluminescence could change with magnetic field, which are called magnetic field effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic field effects are generated through spin-dependent process affected by the internal magnetic interaction. In nonmagnetic materials, hyperfine interaction has been supposed to dominantly affect the spin-dependent process recently.  But the conclusion was made in weak spin-orbital coupling organic semiconductor. The hyperfine interaction might not be the main reason responsible for magnetic field effects in strong spin-orbital coupling materials. Therefore, the study of magnetic field effects in strong spin-orbital coupling organic semiconductor is important to get a whole view of the origin of the magnetic field effects in nonmagnetic organic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dissertation will clarify the generation mechanism of magnetic field effect in nonmagnetic organic semiconductors and further explore how the strong spin-orbital coupling affecting the magnetic field effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been found the intermolecular excited states are important inter-median for magnetic field effects. The change of intersystem crossing at intermolecular excited states will change the singlet/triplet ratio and further generate magnetic field effects through different recombination and dissociation properties of singlet and triplet intermolecular excited states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the energy transfer effect coupled spin orbital coupling and energy transfer effect free spin orbital-coupling are discussed in the dissertation. The tuning of the magnetic field effect by adjusting the spin-orbital coupling is also established through distance effect and interface effect. It has been found that changing inter-molecular spin-orbital coupling is a critical factor to generate magnetic field effects in organic semiconductors. And the sensitivity of different magnetic field effects to strong spin-orbital coupling strength is depending on the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internal magnetic interaction can be hyperfine interaction, spin orbital coupling and spin-spin interaction between electrons. The hyperfine interaction and spin orbital coupling are important in nonmagnetic organic semiconductors. But the electron spin-spin interaction is important in magnetic organic semiconductors. The magnetocurrent for magnetic and nonmagnetic organic semiconductors at different temperature has been compared.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
