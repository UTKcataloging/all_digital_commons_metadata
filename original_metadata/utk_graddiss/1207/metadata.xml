</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Since the first modern state-sponsored lottery was instituted in New Hampshire in 1964, lotteries have proliferated to 42 states and the District of Colombia.  With little exception, research has shown that these lotteries are a highly regressive form of taxation.  However, this body of research does not take into account a theoretical finding that the manner in which collected funds are earmarked impacts participation patterns.  The goal of this dissertation is to test this finding empirically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first analysis, I use sales data from the Tennessee Education Lottery and scholarship data from the TEL Scholarship program to test this theory directly.  I find that instant game sales are increasing in the number of scholarships awarded in a given county and that the implicit tax incidence is less regressive than in certain other states.  Theory does not hold for Powerball sales.  This may be due to a misconception that buying into a multi-state game does not directly subsidize programs in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second analysis, I focus on the Texas Lottery, which began as a revenue stream for the stateâ€™s General Fund, but eventually became a dedicated revenue stream for K-12 education.  I exploit this change to test for a structural break in the demand for two lottery games.  Then, I extend an existing theory of lottery demand to take this structural break into account.  I find that there is a structural break at the time the earmark is implemented, and that the lottery is less regressive after the earmark.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
