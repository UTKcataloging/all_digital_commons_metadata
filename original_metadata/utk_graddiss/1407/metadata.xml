</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The current study assessed the effects of work role stress on burnout, engagement and turnover intention. In addition, the mediating effects of satisfaction with one’s supervisor were assessed. The Job Demands Resources theory was used as a basis for the construction of the current theoretical model. The study utilized a population of non-exempt employees from a large land grant university who worked at Research and Education Centers performing manual agricultural labor. This non-exempt population is a population that is largely overlooked in literature. Findings confirmed that work role stress does have an effect on burnout and engagement, but no effect on turnover intention was supported. In addition, satisfaction with my supervisor was found to partially mediate the effects of work stress on burnout and fully mediate the effects of work stress on engagement. Implications of these findings are included with ideas to implement directives that can reduce stress and burnout and increase engagement and satisfaction with one’s supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
