</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-directed learning and information literacy. Participants completed the Personal Orientation in Self-Directed Learning Scale ([PRO-SDLS], Stockdale, 2003) and the Information Literacy Test ([ILT], James Madison University, 2003). The PRO-SDLS is a self-report scale consisting of 25 statements about self-directed learning preferences in college classrooms. The ILT is a 60-item multiple-choice test that assesses the information literacy skills of college students. Correlation, ANOVA, and multiple regressions were used to test relationships and differences between self-directed learning and information literacy. Despite claims that teaching information literacy creates self-directed learners, composite scores on the PRO-SDLS and the ILT indicated no statistically significant relationship exists. Likewise, no statistically significant differences were found between the bachelors, masters, or doctoral level participant scores. While composite scores on the PRO-SDLS did not predict scores on the ILT, there was a negative, statistically significant relationship between the Initiative factor on the PRO-SDLS and ACRL (2000) Information Literacy Competency Standard 5 â€“ Ethics &amp; Understanding sub-scale of the ILT. Implications for practice and suggestions for further research are proposed along with discussions and conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
