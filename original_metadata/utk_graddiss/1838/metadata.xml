</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Blended instruction usually describes a combination of learning environments in which major components of the instruction are delivered online with the remainder being face-to-face instruction (Marsh &amp; Mcfadden, 2004; Rossett et al., 2004). Recently, blended instructional methods have been introduced as a means of employing the best strategies of both online and classroom instruction and one of the best solutions for the shortcomings of online learning environments by including human involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate current practices in blended instruction. In particular, the study sought to examine the predominant characteristics and potential variations of blended instruction in the extensive doctoral research universities as classified by the Carnegie Foundation. Surveys were conducted with a sample of faculty and IHE representatives from the 151 extensive research universities. The survey data included 34 staff responses from 33 different universities and 133 faculty responses from 30 different universities out of the total 151 universities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, blended instruction was defined as an instructional delivery method in which any portion of online instruction is replaced by classroom instruction. The study examined instructional activities that might or might not be consistent with this definition or challenges encountered by the users as well as advantages of blended instruction perceived by the users. The study also identified institutional support, and faculty usersâ€™ attitudes toward and perceptions of blended instruction.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
