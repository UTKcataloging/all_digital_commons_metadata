</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Between 1990 and 2002, breast cancer mortality rates decreased by over 2% each year. Regular screening mammography is largely credited with the decline as it permits detection of breast cancer at its most treatable stage. In the United States approximately 75% of women over forty years of age report mammography screening within the past two years. However, rates vary by age, income, education, and residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of screening mammography compliance in women living in rural and urban areas of Tennessee; as well as the associated risk factors with special emphasis on risk associated with rural residence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using combined data from the Tennessee Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2001 and 2003), compliance with having accessed a screening mammogram within a two-year period was examined for a sample of 1922 women 40 years and older. Demographic, behavioral, and health-related variables were used to explore associations with compliance. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the association between residence and compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of screening mammography compliance (71.3% 95% CI 67.4-75.2) in women living in rural areas of Tennessee was significantly different from the prevalence of compliance in women living in urban areas (78.3% 95% CI 75.9-80.7). Significantly higher rates of compliance were associated with income â‰¥ $50,000, having at least a high school education, having health insurance, having a personal healthcare giver, non-smoking, recent use of alcohol, recent clinical breast exam or Pap test, and meeting the Healthy People 2010 (HP2010) recommendation for physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After controlling for all other factors, residence was not significantly associated with likelihood of compliance. Specific to rural women, identifying a personal healthcare giver and smoking status were significantly associated with increased likelihood of compliance. These associations can be used by health educators and service providers for identifying at-risk population and making programmatic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
