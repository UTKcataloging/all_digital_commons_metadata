</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Chemical sensors have become major analytical tools for how we monitor&lt;br /&gt;and obtain information about the chemical nature of ourselves and our&lt;br /&gt;surroundings. Two characteristics of chemical sensors that are under constant&lt;br /&gt;development and improvement are their selectivity and their sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Selectivity is a concern of any chemical sensor, without it the signal obtained by&lt;br /&gt;a chemical sensor cannot be related to the target species concentration with any&lt;br /&gt;confidence. With chemical sensors the selectivity is generally created by the&lt;br /&gt;used of a chemical recognition layer such as a permeable membrane, or a thin&lt;br /&gt;chemical film. The sensitivity of a chemical sensor is a concern, as with any&lt;br /&gt;quantitative analytical method, so that small differences in analyte concentration&lt;br /&gt;are distinguishable and trace analysis can be performed. In this work the&lt;br /&gt;selectivity and sensitivity of two distinctly different devices used as chemical&lt;br /&gt;sensors are investigated. The first device combines a scintillation fiber with a&lt;br /&gt;selective polymer coating to create a chemical sensor selective for 137Cs. Both&lt;br /&gt;the selectivity and sensitivity of the scintillation fiber are improved with the&lt;br /&gt;addition of the chemical recognition layer. The second device investigated is a&lt;br /&gt;microcantilever sensor. Microcantilevers have been used to monitor chemicals&lt;br /&gt;present in both air and liquid environments. However, in moving from&lt;br /&gt;measurements made in air to measurements made in liquids, a great deal of&lt;br /&gt;sensitivity is lost due to differences in the interfacial energies of the&lt;br /&gt;v&lt;br /&gt;microcantilevers in these two different environments. To overcome this limitation&lt;br /&gt;surface modification of the microcantilevers was investigated to improve the&lt;br /&gt;sensitivity of these devices. Surfaces of the microcantilevers were modified by&lt;br /&gt;several different methods, the binding of gold nanobeads to the surface, creation&lt;br /&gt;of a roughened dealloyed surface, and the physical milling and chemical etching&lt;br /&gt;of grooves into the surface of the microcantilevers, each of these surface&lt;br /&gt;modifications was shown to enhance the sensitivity of microcantilever chemical&lt;br /&gt;senors over microcantilever chemical sensors with smooth surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
