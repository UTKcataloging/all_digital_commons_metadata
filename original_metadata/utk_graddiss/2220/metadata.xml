</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has demonstrated that coaches experience stress due to the nature of their job and that it may affect their physical and mental well-being (e.g., Richman, 1992; Wang &amp; Ramsey, 1998).   The purpose of this study was to achieve a greater understanding of coaches’ experiences with stress, the perceived effects of stress on their coaching performance, and their coping strategies. A semi-structured interview approach was utilized with 10 NCAA Division I male and female head coaches.  The five major themes identified in the data were:  contextual/conditional factors, sources of stress, responses and effects of stress, managing stress, and sources of enjoyment.  The results are discussed in relation to Smith’s (1986) cognitive-affective model of stress.  Implications for practitioners and opportunities for future research are suggested with the objective of helping coaches more effectively manage the stress of their profession.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
