</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the phenomenon of risk management in global supply chains. Drawing from logistics, supply chain management, operations management, economics, international business, and strategy literatures and a qualitative study, a comprehensive conceptual model of environment-strategy fit for risk management in global supply chains was developed. External environmental conditions comprising of supply and demand risks, four risk management strategies, namely hedging, assuming, postponement, and speculation, and a moderator in the form of a port disruption were chosen for further investigation. The model was quantitatively tested using a simulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from this dissertation study reflect mixed results. Findings that conform to existing research, primarily related to hedging and speculation strategies, provide empirical support for extant knowledge that is primarily conceptual or experience-based. On the other hand, findings that are contrary to existing knowledge or are supported under very select conditions, primarily related to assuming and postponement strategies, provide interesting new insights into the phenomenon. The findings add to both theoretical and practical understanding of the phenomenon. This research opens up several new research directions that indicate that continued research is needed to facilitate both theoretical and empirical progress in better understanding of risk management in global supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
