A series of films were formed from three different polyethylenes with a range crystallinities using melt pressing, a controlled cooling rate, and subsequent heat treatments. The samples were tested on a novel device called the polymer characterization device that measures the water transfer flux as a function of temperature. The samplesâ€™ morphology was examined using differential gradient column, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared microscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffractions, small-angle X-ray scattering, and small angle light scattering, and scanning electron microscopy. When the water transfer flux was expressed as the frost point of a dry carrier gas the results showed a remarkable sensitivity that allows for analysis of subtle distinction in rates due to changes in morphology. Analysis showed that the water transfer flux is a function of the polymer, conditions of the samples preparation from the melt, and any subsequent heat treatment. Another interesting finding was that the time for the sample to reach a steady state water transfer flux is a function of morphology. A free volume model was developed to that simulates the response of the polymer as a function of morphology, presence of water, and thermal cycling. The conclusion of this work is that the water transfer flux is a function of the specific polymer, the initial formation conditions, and later heat treatments and with this knowledge the polymer could be made with a specific water transfer flux.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
