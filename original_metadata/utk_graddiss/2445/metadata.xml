</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;E-bikes have emerged in recent years as a valid mode of transportation. Comparable to regular bicycles in many ways, e-bikes offer some added advantages due to the additional electric motor on the bicycle. This dissertation combines three different research efforts centered on the study of e-bikes and their inclusion in e-bike sharing systems. First, it looks at a model for e-bike sharing at the University of Tennessee and examines system operations, performance, and demand from users. It investigates the characteristics of trips using the sharing systemâ€™s fleet of regular and electric bicycles, and it describes the preferences among system users that influence their mode choice. Second, this dissertation presents a study on user safety, investigating user behaviors of those who use the regular bicycles and e-bikes that are a part of the e-bike sharing system. GIS analysis is incorporated to study user movements on roadways, shared-use facilities, and at intersections. Comparisons are made between bicycle types and facility types with regard to safety. Lastly, this dissertation presents a study on physical health implications for users of regular bicycles and e-bikes and compares those impacts to walking trips. It also presents a methodology for extending this study to naturalistic data collected through the on-campus e-bike sharing system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
