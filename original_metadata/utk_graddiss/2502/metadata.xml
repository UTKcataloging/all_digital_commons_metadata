<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Due  to  the  shortage  of  3He  (helium-3),  there  is  a  great  demand  to  develop alternative  technologies  for  thermal  neutron  detection.  The  Department  of Homeland  security  is  interested  in  applications  with  polymeric  scintillation detectors  that  can  directly  discriminate  between  neutron  and  gamma  radiation using  manufacturing  techniques  that  are  both  inexpensive  and  which  can  be effectively  implemented  to  produce  large-area  detectors.  The  6Li  (lithium-6)   isotope  has  a  significant  thermal  neutron  cross-section  and  produces  highenergy   charged  particles  upon  thermal  neutron  absorption.  This  research focuses on  the development of small-diameter  fibers  (micro-/nanoscale)  loaded with  6Li  for  thermal  neutron  detection  by  electrospinning  and  melt-spinning methods.  Electrospun  polymer  nanofibers  are  attractive  due  to  their  unique volume-to-surface  area  as  well  as  their  chemical,  electrical,  and  optical properties.  The  fibers  are  characterized  by  polymeric  properties,  including microstructure  evaluation,  response  to  thermal  neutrons,  and  alpha,  beta,  and gamma  radiation  using  suitable  radiation  facilities.  6Li-loaded  polyethylene naphthalate  (PEN)  oriented  microfibers  were  fabricated  by  melt-spinning  and tested for thermal neutron detection.  Additionally, (PEN)-based microfibers were integrated  with  carbon  fiber/vinyl  ester-reinforced  backing  to  form  a  composite laminate  with  the  dual  function  of  serving  as  a  scintillator  and  a  structural composite  material.  Laminate  scintillators  were  evaluated  to  study  the mechanical  properties  and  the  effect  of  scintillation  performance.  Important microstructural  information  using  a  digital  optical  microscope  and  mechanical behavior, including the modulus, are both reported.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
