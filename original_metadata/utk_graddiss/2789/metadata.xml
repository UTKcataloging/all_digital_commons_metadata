<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Centrosomes are the only non-membranous organelles in most vertebrate cells and their major function is to nucleate microtubules, hence often recognized as the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC). Much like chromosome centrosome duplicates only once during the S phase of each cell cycle. The fidelity and timing of this duplication event will ensure equal division of duplicated chromosomes into the daughter cells. As a consequence, numerical and/or structural centrosome abnormalities will cause chromosome missegregation and lead to the generation of multiple mitosis and ultimately chromosomal instability, which typify many cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanism of centrosome duplication remains unclear. Previous studies found that a fraction of human proline-directed phosphatase Cdc14B associates with centrosomes. However, Cdc14Bâ€™s involvement in centrosome cycle control has never been explored. In this study, we identify Cdc14B as a negative regulator in centrosome cycle control: depletion of Cdc14B by RNA interference leads to centriole amplification in both HeLa and normal human fibroblast BJ and MRC-5 cells; ectopic expression of Cdc14B leads to stepwise loss of centrioles and attenuates centriole amplification in HU/APH arrested S phase cells and cells treated with proteasome inhibitor Z-L3VS. This inhibitory function requires centriole-associated Cdc14B catalytic activity. In addition, our data suggests counterbalancing effects between Cdc14B phosphatase and kinases such as Plk4, Cdk2/Cyclin-E/A in centrosome duplication control potentially through modulating phosphorylation status of their common downstream effectors, HsSas-6 and B23 respectively. Taken together, these results suggest a potential function for Cdc14B phosphatase in maintaining the fidelity of centrosome duplication cycle.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
