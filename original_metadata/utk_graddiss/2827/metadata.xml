</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study examined the effects of a four-week long self-administered self-compassion training on trauma-related guilt in a sample of homeless veterans in transitional housing. Changes in self-compassion, trauma-related guilt, resilience, PTSD severity, and general distress in the self-compassion intervention group (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 13) were studied and compared to a coping with stress (control) group (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 14). Participation in the four-week long self-administered self-compassion training led to significant reductions in trauma-related guilt. Both interventions seemed equally effective at reducing trauma-related guilt. The results from this study lay the foundation for the use of self-compassion training as an effective treatment for trauma-related guilt. This research suggests that self-administered trainings in the form of workbooks may be a viable, cost-effective form of intervention for disadvantaged populations, such as homeless veterans in transitional housing, who lack resources or access to professionals or paraprofessionals. The role of self-compassion training as a possible adjunct to existing evidence-based treatments for PTSD, the effects of coping with stress training on the study variables, and directions for future research on self-compassion and trauma-related guilt are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
