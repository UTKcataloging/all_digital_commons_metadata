It is also believed that more research should be directed toward the factors which seem to have a definite effect upon the superintendent&#39;s action during the process of public school desegregation. Perhaps more intensive research in a single school system, where this is possible, would shed additional light upon the action of the superintendent and the causes of this action. The behavioral patterns which emerged from action taken by all ten superintendents were evaluated to some extent in the companion study. However, it seems probable that a series of studies which involved many people in each system would make the patterns of action more meaningful. This would appear especially true if these patterns were the result of intensive research in each system suggested.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
