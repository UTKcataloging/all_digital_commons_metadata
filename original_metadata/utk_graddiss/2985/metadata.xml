</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of this study was to develop a profile of selected health promotion beliefs, attitudes and activities of Tennessee primary care physicians.  A secondary purpose was to identify physiciansâ€™ perceived need for training and support activities in health promotion on selected lifestyle behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was undertaken using a mail survey of 628 randomly selected primary care physicians practicing medicine in Tennessee.  The target population was stratified on the basis of the following subgroups:  specialty, population size of county, and state grand division in which they practice.  Four hundred sixty-one questionnaires were returned resulting in a 73.4% response rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the cross classified data took place busing logistic tests for multivariate discrete data.  Analysis of the findings of this investigation led to the following conclusions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Interspeciality differences exist among Tennessee primary care physicians with response to the frequency in which they gather information from their patients on smoking, alcohol, diet, and stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Significant interspeciality differences exist among Tennessee primary care physicians with response to their self-reported success in counseling patients on smoking and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Tennessee primary care physicians tend to agree that there is a need for information and training concerning health promotion in smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise, stress, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Tennessee primary care physicians report that support and assistance would be valuable in helping patients with health promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. There is some evidence of a relationship between Tennessee primary care physicians&#39; self-reported health behavior and self-reported success in counseling patients on smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise, stress and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
