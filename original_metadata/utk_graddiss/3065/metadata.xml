This study was designed to search for a method of early detection of possible reading comprehension skill problems. Early identification of students who may be predisposed to problems with particular reading comprehension skills could lead to earlier intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and the Tennessee Comprehensive Assessment Program (TCAP) score of 400 college bound high school students were paired and analyzed. The thirteen reading comprehension skills showed a statistical difference in the mastery level of seven of these skills, based upon personality types. For five of these skills a pattern of mastery was also established. For the six reading comprehension skills where there was no significant difference, the result was predictable. When the number of non-mastery students is less than 10% of the total population, it is improbable that a pattern will be detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The homogeneous population was a planned limitation of the study. The variables of motivation and ability were eliminated, as was the range of performance. The researcher believes that a heterogeneous population will yield more definitive results and hopes to see this study extended to other populations, including other age groups.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
