</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study examined the relationships among high academic achievement as measured by ACT scores and participation in honors and/or gifted programming, high levels of self-reported interests and skills, and dysfunctional career thoughts. Participants were 143 first and second-year undergraduate students from two southeastern US universities. Along with demographics, data was collected from the Self-Directed Search (SDS) and Career Thoughts Inventory (CTI). Results suggested a positive relationship between high academic achievement and a greater number of career options to consider pursuing. Specifically, those enrolled in gifted and/or honors programs reported significantly more interests and competencies in a number of domains based on Hollandâ€™s RIASEC model. However, there was no relationship between high academic achievement or high interest and skills and dysfunctional career thoughts. In fact, non-honors students displayed significantly more decision-making confusion in comparison to those enrolled in honors programming. The findings have implications for both researchers and practitioners.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
