</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this dissertation was to determine the mechanics of the cam-post mechanism for subjects implanted with a Rotating Platform (RP) PS TKA, Fixed Bearing (FB) PS TKA or FB Bi-Cruciate Stabilized (BCS) TKA. Additionally, a secondary goal of this dissertation was to investigate the feasibility of vibroarthrography in correlating in-vivo vibrations with features exhibited in native, arthritic and implanted knees. In-vivo, 3D kinematics were determined for subjects implanted with nine knees with a RP-PS TKA, five knees with a FB-PS TKA, and 10 knees with a FB-BCS TKA, while performing a deep knee bend. Distance between the cam-post surfaces was monitored throughout flexion and the predicted contact map was calculated. A forward dynamic model was constructed for 3 test cases to determine the variation in the nature of contact forces at the cam-post interaction. Lastly, a different set of patients was monitored using vibroarthrography to determine differences in vibration between native, arthritic and implanted knees. Posterior cam-post engagement occurred at 34° for FB-BCS, 93&lt;sup&gt;o &lt;/sup&gt;for FB-PS and at 97° for RP-PS TKA. In FB-BCS and FB-PS knees, the contact initially occurred on the medial aspect of the tibial post and then moved centrally and superiorly with increasing flexion. For RP-PS TKA, it was located centrally on the post at all times. Force analysis determined that the forces at the cam-post interaction were 1.6*body-weight, 2.0*body-weight, and 1.3*body-weight for the RP-PS, FB-BCS and FB-PS TKA. Sound analysis revealed that there were distinct differences between native and arthritic knees which could be differentiated using a pattern classifier with 97.5% accuracy. Additionally, vibrations from implanted knees were successfully correlated to occurrences such as lift-off and cam-post engagement. This study suggests that mobility of the polyethylene plays a significant role in ensuring proper cam-post interaction in RP-PS TKA. The polyethylene insert rotates axially in accord with the rotating femur, maintaining central cam-post contact. This phenomenon was not observed in the FB-BCS and FB-PS TKAs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
