</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Male and female high school students participated in an intervention designed to promote behavior change in food selection. The students were divided in two groups. Group I received the point-of-purchase cafeteria-based nutrition education program, and Group II received the point-of-purchase cafeteria based nutrition program plus a brief classroom nutrition education intervention. Evaluation instruments included pre-test, post-test 1, and post-test 2 written questionnaires, which included food practices, nutrition knowledge, attitudes and their perceptions about the school food service and the point-of-purchase intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For behavior change, there was a significant Time Effect for females Group II with a significant decrease in both fat and vitamin C. Both genders in Group II had a significant decrease in energy intake. Males in Group II had a significant decrease in their fat intake and intakes of calcium and vitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of the comparison of the subjects&#39; mean nutrient intakes at lunch intakes showed that energy for both males and females was below one-third of the RDA, the standard for the National School Lunch Program. For calcium and iron males met one-third of the RDA, while females did not. For vitamins A and C, both genders were above the standard while for vitamin D, both genders were below the RDA. Both genders were above the â‰¤30% guideline for proportion of energy from fat; 34% and 31% for males and females, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nutrition knowledge, there was no significant difference for Time Effect or for Group Effect for either gender. For nutrition attitudes, there was a significant decrease in positive nutrition attitudes only for males Group II. For Group Effect, no significant difference was found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frequency of selection for certain targeted foods showed that for Group I there was a significant increase in their selection of fresh fruit. And for females in Group II, there was a significant increase in their selection of low fat milks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Expected taste&quot; was the reason the students gave for choosing the foods they did on the designated days. Three-fourths of the students states that the Best Choice signs near the serving line &quot;were a good idea&quot;. Recommendation for greater changes in behavior, knowledge, and attitudes include a longer, more focused classroom nutrition education component and cafeteria serving styles which allow students more choices, especially among vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
