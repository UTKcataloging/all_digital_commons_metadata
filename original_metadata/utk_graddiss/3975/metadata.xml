</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Stability is a critical concern in the design and maintenance of power systems. Different approaches have been proposed for the analysis of power grid stability in various scenarios depending on small or large perturbations and the speed of the phenomenon of interest. In this work, we consider the power grid as a group of flocking birds, as synchronization is the key issue in both contexts. The framework of partial difference equation (PdE) is used to analyze the system stability, when designing the communication network of the power grid network for conveying measurements between different power stations. Both the cases where communication network delay is negligible and non-negligible are studied here. The communication network design problem is formulated as an optimization problem under the consideration of a stable power grid. Corresponding optimization algorithms are designed to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To convey measurements of the power network, wireless sensor networks is adopted, for its non-invasive and easy deployment properties. Periodic sleep scheduling is adopted to effectively save energy for the wireless sensor networks. To provide a controllable end-to-end delay for the communication networks, a dynamic duty cycle control approach is designed, featuring a single-hop delay controller based on the well known feedback control theory. The delay control approach also features a queuing delay adaptation scheme that adapts the duty cycle of each node to unpredictable packet rates, as well as a novel energy balancing approach that extends the network lifetime by dynamically adjusting the delay requirement allocated to each hop.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
