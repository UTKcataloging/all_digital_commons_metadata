Fat (beef plates approximately 55% fat) from animals fed grain was finely ground. Flaked meat and fat were mixed and formed into 227-g restructured steaks with 15%, 20%, or 25% fat. Steaks were cooked in a microwave oven on a preheated browning dish or broiled in a conventional oven to an internal temperature of 73&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C Â± 2&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C or 73&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greater cooking losses were exhibited for steaks heated in a microwave oven than were found with conventional heating. Objective measurements of tenderness indicated conventionally heated steaks were more tender than microwave-heated steaks. As the level of fat increased, tenderness, as determined by objective methods, generally increased. Generally, as the number of days an animal was on grain increased, Warner-Bratzler shear values decreased. Total microbial destruction was exhibited by both cooking methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 10-member experienced panel evaluated the steaks for various characteristics using an unstructured, 150-mm descriptive scale. Steaks cooked in the microwave oven were less tender, had less moisture released, and appeared to be more well-done than steaks broiled in the conventional oven. As fat level increased in the steaks, tenderness, moisture released, greasiness, and acceptability also increased while off-flavor of the steaks decreased. Cooking method, fat level, or number of days on feed did not affect acceptability as judged by a 36-member consumer panel. It appeared that the use of fat from grain-fed animals minimized tenderness, juiciness, and off-flavor problems reported to be associated with meat from grass-fed animals. This study indicated that it would be feasible to utilize meat from grass-fed animals in the formation of restructured steaks. An increase in fat level was shown to positively affect the characteristics of the steaks.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
