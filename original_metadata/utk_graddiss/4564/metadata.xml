</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;A multiple-baseline-across-participants design was used to evaluate the efficacy of Solution-focused Brief Counseling (SFBC) for six fifth grade students with math assignment completion problems.  Weekly 30-minute sessions of SFBC for 5 weeks were sufficient to produce increases in both completion rates (from 29% completion during baseline to 79.63% during treatment) and accuracy rates (from 23.50% during baseline to 50.01% during treatment).  Most increases were maintained during a 1 to 3 week follow up period.  In addition, the criterion-related validity of Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) was evaluated by comparing predicted completion and accuracy rates to actual achievement.  Independent t tests between predicted and achieved scores revealed significant differences for five out of six participants (Î± set to .05).  Thus, the validity of GAS in educational settings is questionable when predicted scores can be compared to objective measures of performance in academic settings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
