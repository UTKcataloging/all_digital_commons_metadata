</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study was undertaken in order to learn the basic biology of the strawberry leaf roller Ancylis comptana fragariae in Tennessee. Shortly after the initiation of the study, it was found that not one, but several forms of leaf roller larvae were involved in the damage being done to strawberries. The study was therefore broadened to include the entire complex of leaf roller species and subspecies which inflict damage to strawberries and sometimes to other host plants in Tennessee. Three of the eleven forms making up the complex were selected as being most important because of their abundance and the amount of damage done by them. These three leaf rollers were Ancylis comptana fragariae, Ptycholoma peritana, and Olethreutes cespitana. The basic biology of each species was thoroughly investigated, and the results are recorded herein. Pertinent biological facts concerning the other eight species discovered during the course of this study are likewise presented.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
