</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Climosequence Vertisol profiles derived from the Upper Beaumont Formation in the Gulf Coastal Prairie physiographic province of Texas were examined for geochemical trends ascribed to different precipitation regimes. Mass-balance relationships were utilized for the comparisons. Compositional differences in zirconium (Zr) content between the solum and lower sub-soil precluded it use an immobile strain (volumetric change) indicator. This difference was correlated to sand weight percent (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.65**). Titanium (Ti) content did not shift correlatively with depth, thus making Ti the preferred strain index element for mass-balance calculations. Depths at which the Zr compositions shifted were not directly related to mean annual precipitation (MAP) regime and are considered to be functional boundaries between open-system pedogenesis and more closed system hydrogeochemical weathering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass-balance relationships of ten elements examined within the climosequence showed trends ascribed to precipitation intensity. Mass-balance relationships varied not only between locations but also between microtopographic positions within each Vertisol pedon. Basic mass-balance trends with depth in the climosequence profiles fall into four broad categories depending on the relative mobility and geochemical reactivity of the individual elements: 1) framework, 2) clay interaction, 3) leachable/biocycle, and 4) climatic/redox-sensitive. Net mass flux percentages indicate a relative steady-state of around -16% (Â±3%) in climosequence Vertisol pedons with MAP &gt; 900 mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total Fe (Fe&lt;sub&gt;TOT&lt;/sub&gt;) content of pedogenic iron-manganese (Fe-Mn) nodules from Vertisol profiles correlates with mean annual precipitation (MAP, r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.92***). No significant trend of Fe&lt;sub&gt;TOT&lt;/sub&gt; with depth was noted in profiles. Using the regression developed from modem Vertisol data, Feror contents of Paleozoic paleo-Vertisol Fe-Mn nodules yielded MAP regimes comparable to previously inferred paleoenvironmental interpretations. Paleoprecipitation estimates derived from Fe-Mn nodules for an uneroded, Late Mississippian paleo-Vertisol are very close to estimates made from a depth to pedogenic carbonate horizon (DCH) proxy determined from the modem Vertisol climosequence. Because the Fe-Mn nodule proxy is independent of depth, consistent paleoprecipitation estimates can be made even in eroded paleo-Vertisols and, in combination with the DCH, may be useful in determining original paleosol thickness.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
