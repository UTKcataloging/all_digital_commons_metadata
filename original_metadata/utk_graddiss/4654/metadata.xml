</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Educational outcomes of college students (e.g., GPA, retention, graduation, and years to graduation) of undergraduate students screened and selected for 2e status (2e; giftedness with a learning disability) did not differ significantly &lt;em&gt;(p&lt;/em&gt; &gt; .05) based on two operationalizations (of 2e status): ACT or SAT scores. However, significantly more 2e students were screened from ACT scores relative to the number screened from SAT scores (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &lt; .05). Further investigation into academic outcomes revealed that students screened as 2e by the ACT were significantly more likely to be retained after their first year of college when they declared a major in line with their academic strength (&lt;em&gt;p &lt;/em&gt;&lt; .05), relative to the number retained by the SAT. Finally, 2e students screened by the ACT were less likely to graduate within six years of initial enrollment at UT when they did not declare a major in line with their academic strength, though the difference was not statistically significant &lt;em&gt;(p&lt;/em&gt; &gt; .05). Implications are discussed, and particularly suggestions regarding how these data may improve advising practices.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
