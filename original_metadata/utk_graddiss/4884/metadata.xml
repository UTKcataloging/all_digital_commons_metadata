<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Social/political or legislative professional advocacy is vital for growth of the counseling profession. However, knowledge regarding social/political professional advocacy is limited by a lack of empirical evidence. The purpose of this constructivist grounded theory study was to explain the process of social/political professional advocacy for counseling leaders. The research question guiding this study was &lt;i&gt;what is the process of social/political professional advocacy for counseling leaders?&lt;/i&gt; Constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2014) was used to analyze fifteen semi-structured interviews with professional counselors who engaged in leadership related to social/political professional advocacy. During analysis, four major themes emerged, &lt;i&gt;Connection to Personal and Professional Identity, Use of Personal and Professional Community, Making it your Own,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Picking your Battles&lt;/i&gt;. Findings suggested that the legislative professional advocacy process involved three tiers &lt;i&gt;Advocacy Catalyst, Advocacy Action, and Advocacy Training&lt;/i&gt;. The &lt;i&gt;Advocacy Catalyst&lt;/i&gt; provided connection to the advocacy need. &lt;i&gt;Advocacy Action&lt;/i&gt;, involved ways that advocates acted upon advocacy by picking battles and making it their own. &lt;i&gt;Advocacy Training&lt;/i&gt; provided participants with support and knowledge to apply to their &lt;i&gt;Advocacy Action&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, using an aggregate of the participantsâ€™ own perspective and experience, a definition of legislative professional advocacy was proposed. Based on these findings, implications for counselor education programs and professional organizations and recommendations for future research were provided.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
