<abstract>&lt;p&gt;A qualitative interview study was undertaken to describe factors central to the decision of National Merit Scholars in attending the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. In addition, this study sought to discover how National Merit Scholars who had attended the university viewed the academic quality of the university after having attended for at least two semesters. The study sought to answer four questions: 1. What factors influenced National Merit Scholars to enroll at UTK? 2. What indicators of institutional quality do National Merit Scholars use to assess the academic reputation and quality of an institution? 3. What perceptions did enrolled National Merit Scholars have about the academic reputation and quality of UTK before they enrolled? Did that perception change in any significant way after they have been in attendance for at least two semesters. 4. What suggestions do National Merit Scholars offer for making the University of Tennessee more attractive to high ability students? The study utilized twenty-five face-to-face interviews with National Merit Scholars who had attended UTK for at least two semesters, in addition to relevant documents readily available at the university, past and present UTK administrators, Internet sources, UTK staff and observations made during the interviews. Findings from the study showed that National Merit Scholars do not perceive UTK to be a high quality academic institution before attendance. The major factor influencing their initial attendance is the perception that the university does offers an exceptional educational value, as evidenced by scholarship/financial aid package offered coupled with the perception that UTK offers superior programs of study in participants&#39; desired program of study. The participants who reported that their perception of UTK had changed positively cited the UTK faculty, Honors Program, and opportunities offered at UTK as influencing these changes. Those participants who reported that their perception had changed negatively toward the academic quality of the university cited lack of sufficient state funding and the UTK administration as influencing these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
