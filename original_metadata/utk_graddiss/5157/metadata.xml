<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study describes the collaborative learning experiences of a community college instructor and her students in an information technology course. Peters and Armstrong&#39;s (1998) Types of Teaching and Leaming model served as a framework for the instructor&#39;s introduction of collaborative learning ï¿½to a traditionally-taught course, and Peters&#39; ( 1998) approach to action research was used as the principal method of inquiry. Phenomenological and semi-structured interviews, field notes, and researcher journal entries generated the data. The ethnographic methods of Spradley (1980) and Hatch (2002) were used to analyze data. The inductive analysis surfaced four themes: relationships, positioning, dialogue, and mindfulness. These themes described the participants&#39; experience with learning how to learn software applications. The themes also closely approximated the description of three of four elements of Peters and Armstrong&#39;s Type III Teaching and Leaming.  The addition of collaborative learning to the course design enhanced students&#39; learning experience and led to changes in the instructor&#39;s practice. Implications for other college instructors who teach information technology courses are discussed, as are suggestions for employing action research in the college classroom.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
