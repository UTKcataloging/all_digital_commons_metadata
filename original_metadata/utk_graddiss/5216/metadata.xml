<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This research examines the role of ideological, community, and demographic variables in explaining the link between violence against human and nonhuman animals. Based on analysis of special populations such as battered women or prison inmates, current literature links violence against animals to later aggression against humans, suggesting all forms of abuse are connected in a larger network of violence. Through the test of three hypotheses, this study examines these relationships among a randomized sample, and ascertains an incidence rate of animal abuse. First, the graduation hypothesis explores whether individuals engaged in violence against animals as youth, progress to violence against humans at a later stage in the life course. Second, the generality of deviance hypothesis suggests instead that individuals may engage in abuse of animals during youthful experimentation, but mature from this behavior with no further abusive actions toward any species. Third, the masculinities thesis examines the correlations between attitudes toward women and nonhumans, and the role of negative attitudes in predicting abuse against human or nonhuman animals. This project is the first to sample a generalized population, and thus will become significant in informing policy decisions and initiatives already begun to address linkages between various forms of violence.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
