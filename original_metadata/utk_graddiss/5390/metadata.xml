<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Suicide is a serious public health issue in the world (Ra &amp; Cho, 2013). Studies reveal that suicidal ideation may be signal of suicidal actions (Oh, Lee, &amp; Shin, 2014; Park, Cho, &amp; Moon, 2010). Studies also report that about more than 30% of older adults who had serious suicidal ideation made suicide plans (Choi, DiNitto, &amp; Marti, 2015). This means we may prevent suicidal behaviors by reducing suicidal thoughts (Choi et al., 2015; Eom, 2007; Harwood &amp; Jacoby, 2000; Jeong &amp; Kim, 2014; Simons &amp; Murphy, 1985).Intimate Partner Violence among older adults is anticipated to intensify as baby boomers age (Roberto, McPherson, &amp; Brossoie, 2013). IPV negatively influences the mental health of victims, both men and women (Campbell, 2002; Carbone-LÃ³pez, Kruttschnitt, &amp; Macmillan, 2006). Studies show female victims of IPV are at risk of depression in the future even if the IPV stopped (Chuang et al., 2012). Although depression is the critical risk factor for suicidal ideation, some factors may save older adults with depressive symptoms against suicidal ideation (Lee, 2011). However, there is little research examining protective factors against suicidal ideation among older victims of intimate partner violence. The present dissertation consists of three independent papers. The first chapter addresses factors protecting against suicidal ideation among community-dwelling older adults in the U.S. and South Korea: a systematic literature review, the second chapter addresses the impact of protective factors on suicidal ideation among community- dwelling older adults with experience of spousal physical abuse: focusing on direct and indirect effects, and the third chapter addresses the impact of spousal physical abuse on suicidal ideation: focusing on moderating effects of protective factors.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
