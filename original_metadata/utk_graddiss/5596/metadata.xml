<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to compare principals’ perceptions of their socially just leadership practices with their teachers’ perceptions of the socially just leadership practices their principals used in their schools. The theoretical framework that guided this study of principals socially just leadership practices was Critical Race Theory applied to education, a subset of Critical Race Theory(CRT). Data were collected using two researcher constructed surveys, one for the principals and a companion survey for the teachers, to compare principals’ perceptions of their socially just leadership practices with their teachers’ perceptions of the socially just leadership practices their principals used in their schools.  The findings revealed a discrepancy between principals’ and teachers’ perceptions. Principals’ perceptions of the socially just leadership practices they enacted in school was significantly higher than teachers’ overall perceptions of the socially just leadership practices their principals used in schools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
