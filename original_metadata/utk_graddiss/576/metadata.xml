</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This dissertation addresses automated correction and optimized contrast enhancement of multi-line CCD images for inspection and surveillance applications, focusing on three topics: multi-line CCD imaging systems setup, automated correction of multi-line CCD images, and automatic optimized image contrast enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;generation, low cost, etc. However, due to the physical separation of line CCD sensors for the red (R), green (G), blue (B) color channel, the color images acquired by multi-line CCD cameras intrinsically exhibit a color misalignment defect, which is expressed as that the edges of objects in the scene are separated by a certain number of pixels in the R, G, B color planes in the scan direction. This defect, if not corrected properly, can severely degrade the quality of multi-line CCD images and hence the applications of multi-line CCD cameras. We developed an algorithm to automatically correct the color misalignment problem in multi-line CCD images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contrast enhancement plays an important role in image processing applications. Conventional contrast enhancement techniques either often fail to produce satisfactory results for a broad variety of low-contrast images, or cannot be automatically applied to different images, because their processing parameters must be specified manually to produce a satisfactory result for a given image. However, the GLG technique doesnâ€™t have the above drawbacks. The basic procedure of GLG is to first group the histogram components of a low-contrast image into a proper number of bins according to a new image contrast measure developed in this research, Average Pixel Distance on Grayscale (APDG); then remap these bins evenly over the grayscale, and finally ungroup the previously grouped gray-levels. Accordingly, this new technique is named gray-level grouping (GLG). GLG and its variations not only produce results superior to competing contrast enhancement techniques, but are also fully automatic in most circumstances, and are applicable to a broad variety of images.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
