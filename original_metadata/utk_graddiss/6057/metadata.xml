</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;mmWave frequencies ranging between (30-300GHz) have been considered the perfect solution to the scarcity of bandwidth in the traditional sub-6GHz band and to the ever increasing demand of many emerging applications in today&#39;s era. 5G and beyond standards are all considering the mmWave as an essential part of there networks. Beamforming is one of the most important enabling technologies for the mmWave to compensate for the huge propagation lose of these frequencies compared to the sub-6GHz frequencies and to ensure better spatial and spectral utilization of the mmWave channel space. In this work, we tried to develop different techniques to improve the performance of the systems that use mmWave. In the physical layer, we suggested several hybrid beamforming architectures that both are relatively simple and spectrally efficient by achieving fully digital like spectral efficiency (bits/sec/Hz). For the mobility management, we derived the expected degradation that can affect the performance of a special type of beamforming that is called the Random Beamforming (RBF) and optimized the tunable parameters for such systems when working in different environments. Finally, in the networking layer, we first studied the effect of using mmWave frequencies on the routing performance comparing to the performance achieved when using sub-6 GHz frequencies. Then we developed a novel opportunistic routing protocol for Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) that uses a modified version of the Random Beamforming (RBF) to achieve better end to end performance and to reduce the overall delay in delivering data from transmitting nodes to the intended receiving nodes. From all these designs and studies, we conclude that mmWave frequencies and their enabling technologies (i.e. Beamforming, massive MIMO, ...etc.) are indeed the future of wireless communicatons in a high demanding world of Internet of Things (IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and self driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
