Otherwise, there will be created a situation devoid of the strength of real democratic endeavor. The problem of the present study centered on the identification of “Correlates of Administrative Behavior and Organizational Climate” and sought (1) to determine the relationship between the administrative behavior of an elementary school principle (as assessed by the instruments—the Tennessee Rating Guide, 1961 Edition, and the Tennessee Rating Guide, 1961 Edition, and the Tennessee Rating Guide: Adjectival Checklist) and the ranking of his school on overall morale, (2) to determine the relationship between the organizational climate of his school (as assessed by the Organizational Climate Description Questionnaire, Form III) and the ranking of his school on overall morale, and (3) to determine the relationship between the two instruments.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
