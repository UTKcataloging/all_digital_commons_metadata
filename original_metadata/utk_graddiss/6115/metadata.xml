<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of any systematic differences in assessment center ratings as a function of the race and sex of the ratees or the race of the assessors. In effect, the overriding question was to determine if there were discrimination due to race or sex-related biases. The subjects were 256 employees of a large southeastern utility who participated in an assessment center as the initial step for selection into a two-year management development and training program. Participants spent one day in the center, which consisted of three simulations of typical management activities. The exercises were designed to measure the following nine skill dimensions identified by a job analysis as being critical for job success: (1) Leadership, (2) Perception, (3) Adaptability, (4) Decisiveness (refers to the number of decisions made), (5) Decision-making (refers to the quality of decisions), (6) Organization and Planning, (7) Sensitivity, (8) Written Communications, and (9) Oral Communications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
