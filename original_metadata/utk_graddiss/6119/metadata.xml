<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine if knowledge, attitudes and behaviors concerning non-marital sexual activity changed as a result of a 5-day abstinence until marriage program. A valid and reliable survey was distributed to students by their classroom teacher and collected by Hope Resource Center. One hundred thirty-one pairs of pre and post tests were collected from 7th and 8th grade students in five Knox County middle schools. A factor analysis of fifteen Likert scale items showed that these survey questions could be grouped into five subscales. 1) Personal values, 2) parental influence, 3) behavior, 4) peer pressure, and 5) knowledge. Using paired samples tests a significant overall improvement from pre to post presentation questionnaire was determined. Significant improvements occurred in four of the five subscales - personal values, behavior, peer pressure, and knowledge. Males and females changed equally overall, however, females had significantly higher means than the males in the subscales of values, parental influence, behavior and peer pressure. Also noted was an increase in communication with parents. Females were more likely than males to discuss both sexual activity and the program with their parents within the last year. In conclusion, participation of 7th and 8th grade students in a 5-day abstinence until marriage sexuality program may result in an overall positive change in knowledge, attitudes and behavior. Agencies or classroom teachers presenting a 5-day abstinence until marriage sexuality program similar in content to the &quot;Straight Talk about Sexual Health&quot; presentation can anticipate at least a five day improvement in the areas of knowledge, peer pressure, personal values and behavior. Also, classrooms of mixed gender may benefit by selecting the &quot;Straight Talk about Sexual Health&quot; presentation because it has demonstrated equal improvements for male and female students. Unfortunately, due to the&#39; ambiguous nature of the post questionnaire items regardin program materials and delivery, it is difficult to conclude how participants rate this presentation. The results of this study suggest only short-term improvements - more research is needed to determine if these improvements can be maintained over time.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
