<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Health care facilities and schools of nursing are beginning to utilize computer technology. There is limited availability of quality software in nursing for instruction and evaluation. In the present study, a computerized simulation examination to evaluate decision-making in nursing was developed and assessed in terms of its psychometric properties. A clinical situation was established and then converted into a computerized simulation program. The computerized simulation examination was given to groups of nurses and non-nurses in order to improve clarity of instructions and to insure the functioning of the computer program. To obtain data indicating reliability and validity, the computerized simulation examination was given to two additional groups: &quot;novices&quot; who were college students without nursing experience and &quot;experts&quot; who were masters in nursing prepared faculty. Each person&#39;s performance was converted into three scores (performance index, efficiency index, and usefulness). The &quot;known-groups&quot; technique was then used to determine criterion-related validity. The faculty group was also given a questionnaire relating to the content validity of the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
