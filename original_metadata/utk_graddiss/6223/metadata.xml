<abstract>&lt;p&gt;There have been many studies that examine the attitudes of heterosexuals towards lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (Herek &amp; Capitanio, 1999 &amp; 1996; Engstrom &amp; Sedlacek, 1997; Kite &amp; Whitley, 1996; Whitley &amp; Kite, 1995; Pratte, 1993; and Kite, 1984). Currently, there is no qualitative research that focuses on a particular population&#39;s conceptualizations of lesbians. The need for this study lies in the abundance of stereotypes surrounding both lesbians and heterosexual men&#39;s view of lesbians as well as the lack of research. For these reasons, the purpose of the study is to examine the conceptualization of lesbians and lesbian relationships by white, heterosexual, single, 25- 32 year old, college-educated, men, and, secondly, to examine the role socialization plays in this conceptualization. Qualitative research methodology is used for this research and queer theory is the theoretical frame. Long interviews are conducted with nine participants in order to provide their perspective. Four major themes emerge from the interviews: The Road to Conceptualization, Beliefs Regarding Lesbians and Lesbian Relationships, Conceptualization by Comparison, and Conceptualization via Struggle. There are also numerous sub-themes revealed from the data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
