<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Georgia kindergarten teachers are required to assess students using the Georgia Kindergarten Assessment Program — Revised (GKAP-R). The 2000 GKAP-R identified only 6% of the state’s kindergarten students as needing assistance in first grade. However, more than 16% of the students in grades K-3 actually received assistance in the state’s program designed to give extra help to struggling students. In this study, kindergarten and first grade scores for 461 Catoosa County students were analyzed to determine the relationship between student scores on the GKAP-R and first grade achievement as measured by the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills. The results indicate a moderate correlation (adjusted R2 of .354) between the GKAP-R readiness scores and first grade achievement as measured by the ITBS. Introducing age in months as a covariate increases the adjusted R2 to .375.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
