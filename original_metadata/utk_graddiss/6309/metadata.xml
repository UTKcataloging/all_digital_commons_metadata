<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The present study was conducted to evaluate the problem solving ability of children with hearing impairment. This was done using mathematical problems that are a part of the typical school curriculum. The performance of a group of children with hearing impairment (HI Group) was compared to the performance of a group of children with normal hearing (NH Group). The participants were two groups of school-aged children with 13 in each group. The two groups were equated on performance intelligence, language ability, grade level and sex. The participants were asked to solve two types of mathematical problems: those that required computation alone and word problems that required the use of both language and mathematical computation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
