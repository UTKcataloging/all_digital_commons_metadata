<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the relationships among self-esteem, social competence, stress, social support (family and peer), gender, and ethnicity among urban, rural, and suburban adolescents. The participants in this study were drawn from a nationally representative sample of adolescent youth. Analyses of data revealed that there significant correlations between selfesteem, social competence, stress, and family and peer support. Significant differences within gender were found between self-esteem, social competence, peer support, and stress. Also, significant differences within ethnicity were found in self-esteem and peer support. Regression analyses revealed that both family and peer support accounted for a significant degree of the variation on selfesteem. Regression analyses also revealed significant family and peer effects. No significant distinctions between geographic locations and the psychosocial variables (self-esteem, social competence, family and peer support and stress) indicated.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
