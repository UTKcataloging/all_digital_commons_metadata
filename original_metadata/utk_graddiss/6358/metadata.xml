<abstract>&lt;p&gt;During World War II, unprecedented numbers of American women entered nontraditional occupations as they assumed production jobs in the nation&#39;s war plants. The purpose of this dissertation is to determine the impact of the war on women production workers using Knoxville, Tennessee as a test case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information concerning the numerical and percentage increase of women in nontraditional production occupations in Knoxville area war plants was collected. Further, interviews, questionnaires, and local newspaper sources were utilized to determine the attitudes of male and female production workers and the public at large regarding the large scale employment of women in these new jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war produced a dynamic tension for Knoxville female war workers in that it offered increased opportunities for occupational diversity. At the same time, existing prejudices and traditional values regarding women&#39;s place in employment and society remained unchallenged in many quarters. Further, postwar employment patterns of women reflected prewar gender-specific occupational trends. The war, nonetheless, proved to be a strong catalyst for conceptual change in women&#39;s employment in stiumulating an increased awareness that women could successfully perform a &quot;man&#39;s job,&quot; and perhaps have the right to ask for a man&#39;s wages.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
