<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Therapists and researchers alike consider premature termination to be problematic to assessing true outcomes in psychotherapy. Some feel that it is the number one problem facing both researchers and clinicians today. The role induction (RI) procedure, or educating clients about the purpose and process of therapy, is one method that has been found to lower premature termination rates as well as increase positive outcomes in psychotherapy. The current study was designed to investigate the effects of a RI onpremature termination rates, outcome, and measures of therapeutic alliance. The mechanism of RI as a medium in which to influence clients to remain in therapy was also investigated. Sixty-eight clients and their therapists participated in the current research. Each client and the therapist completed outcome and alliance measures at specified points in the therapy. Half (n = 34) of the clients received a role induction and the other half acted as a control group. The role induction was in the form of a 13-minute videotape entitled &quot;What to Expect in Psychotherapy&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
