<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to assess the interactive relationship of college environment and religiosity on the college alcohol experience of students attending two institutions, one secular and one a religious college. Reference group theory was the theoretical foundation utilized in this study. The data for this research was gathered from two college samples, one a secular university and one a religious liberal arts college. Five hundred and twenty-nine students participated in the project. The data was based on student responses to two survey instruments. The Religiosity Measure is an eight-item survey that assesses religiosity, and the College Alcohol Survey is a twenty-page survey that investigates collegiate alcohol use. A pilot study was carried out using twenty-one college students to assess the survey instruments. A variety of statistical procedures were used, including Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman Rho correlations, chi-square, and multinomial logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
