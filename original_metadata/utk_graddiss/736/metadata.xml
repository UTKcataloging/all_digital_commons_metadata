<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rates of bullying and victimization among gifted and non-gifted, high-achieving (HA) high school students were assessed by using the Reynolds Bully Victimization Scale (BVS; Reynolds, 2003). Results indicate that both gifted and HA high school students bully others and are victimized by others at unelevated rates based on scores on the BVS. The rates of bullying and victimization found among gifted and HA high school students were not significantly different from each other as well. Rates of bullying and victimization for male and female participants were also compared, and no significant differences were found between males and females for either bullying or victimization. Results from this study do not provide support for across-the-board social skills programs for gifted students as a group but suggest that gifted programs continue to focus on promoting primarily advanced intellectual endeavors (Colangelo, Assouline, &amp; Gross, 2004). However, individual gifted students may need targeted interventions focused on reducing bullying and victimization.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
