</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Literature, films, and even the daily news often address war, an event that unfortunately has been a constant in modern society.  Large scale, modern warfare with global involvement began with the First World War, and following the war, a global war literature boom occurred.  Two bestselling novels whose anti-war themes still resound today, &lt;em&gt;Im Westen nichts Neues &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/em&gt;) by Erich Maria Remarque and &lt;em&gt;Johnny Got His Gun &lt;/em&gt;by Dalton Trumbo, emerged from this sea of literature.  Both of these novels focus on the pain that is inherent in warfare and its detrimental effects on society as well as on individual soldiers.  The graphic imagery and anti-war sentiment that is present in these novels has generated controversy throughout their histories; however, the popularity of both works has prevailed, and Remarque and Trumboâ€™s novels remain two of the most referenced in academic disciplines as well as in popular culture.  This thesis explores the long-lasting success of these two works as anti-war novels, as measured by initial sales and popularity as well as by a plethora of mass cultural adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
