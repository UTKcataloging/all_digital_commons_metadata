</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The study examined the impacts of the Ready, Set, Go! training program on its participants. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of the Ready, Set Go! program on building community capacity in the state of Tennessee. A survey was developed and administered to 110 participants at the conclusion of their training. One hundred percent (100%) of participants responded. Three respondents (2.7%) were military personnel, three (2.7%) were veterans, and twenty-three (20.7%) had a spouse or family member in the military. Survey data was used to determine participation in the training leads to participants becoming involved in OMK community action. Data was used to determine if perceived utility of program and knowledge gain lead to anticipated involvement with the Operation: Military Kids program. The results showed that perceived utility does correlate to future involvement while knowledge gain does not determine future community action. Future trainings should focus on the relevance of the material so trainees will be interested in participating in community action.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
