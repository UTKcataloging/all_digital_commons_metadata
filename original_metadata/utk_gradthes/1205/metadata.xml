</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The FITNESSGRAMâ€™s Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) test is a commonly used field test to estimate peak oxygen uptake (VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;) in youth.  However, little research has been conducted to determine the influence of weight status on the accuracy of the equations used to estimate VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: To assess the agreement between VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; measured using indirect calorimetry during the PACER and estimated VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; in normal weight and overweight youth and to determine the influence of weight status on the accuracy of estimated VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; in 10-15 year old youth.  &lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: The study included 101 participants that were classified as normal weight (n=78) or overweight (n=23) according to BMI percentiles for age and sex.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Participants completed the PACER, a progressive, multistage, 20-meter shuttle run to volitional exhaustion. VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; was measured during the PACER test using a portable gas analysis system (Oxycon Mobile, CareFusion, Inc.). Estimated VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; values were calculated based on PACER performance using the Leger et al. and Mahar et al. equations.  Paired samples t-tests were used to determine if significant differences existed between estimated and measured VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt;.  Independent t-tests were performed to compare the normal weight and overweight groups.  Accuracy was determined using Bland-Altman plots.  &lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;:  The Leger et al. (44.3 +4.6 ml/kg/min) and Mahar et al. (46.8 +4.8 ml/kg/min) estimated values were significantly lower than measured VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; (49.0 +8.7 ml/kg/min) in the normal weight group. There were no significant differences between measured VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; (38.8 +7.1 ml/kg/min) and predicted values (40.5 +2.5 and 38.2 +6.1 ml/kg/min; Leger et al. and Mahar et al., respectively) for the overweight group.  For the normal weight group, the standard error of the estimate (SEE) was Leger 5.44 ml/kg/min (Leger) and 5.33 ml/kg/min (Mahar). The SEE was 5.77 ml/kg/min&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;(Leger) and 4.54 ml/kg/min&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;(Mahar) for the overweight participants. &lt;strong&gt;Conclusions&lt;/strong&gt;: It appears that the prediction of VO&lt;sub&gt;2peak&lt;/sub&gt; from either equation based on PACER performance varies among weight status group and may be inaccurate for normal weight youth, but acceptable for overweight youth.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
