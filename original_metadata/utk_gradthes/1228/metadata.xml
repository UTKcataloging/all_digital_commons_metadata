</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;PREFACE: Until recent years almost nothing had been written about William Carroll although he was governor of Tennessee for a greater length of time than any other man and is one of Tennessee&#39;s commanding figures. He participated in and was a leading figure in two of the most remarkable achievements in military history: the victory of Horseshoe Bend, and the victory of New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the interesting events of Carroll&#39;s life have yet been placed before the public; both his character and attainments have been neglected by the historians. It is in order to supply in a small measure this deficiency that his definitive biography has been written.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
