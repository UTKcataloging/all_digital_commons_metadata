</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Obesity is characterized by metabolic complications which are related to several life-threatening diseases. Dysregulated inflammatory adipokines secretion from adipose tissue is believed as the major contributor to obesity-associated local and systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and other metabolic dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies in our lab and others pointed to the role of local adipose tissue renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the pathogenesis of obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance. We hypothesized that adipocytes-derived angiotensinogen (Agt) played a critical role in adipogenesis and/or lipogenesis as well as adipose inflammation. To test, we established 3T3-L1 preadipocytes stably transfected with Agt-shRNA or scrambled sequence (Sc-shRNA). Transfected preadipocytes were differentiated and used to investigate the role of adipocytes-derived Agt using microarray and PCR analyses, as well as cytokine/adipokine profiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, results confirmed that Agt gene silencing significantly reduced the expression of Agt and its hormone product angiotensin II (Ang II), as well as lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes compared to cells transfected with Sc-shRNA. Silencing of Agt gene also suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory adipokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î± [alpha]), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microarray studies identified several genes involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways which were down-regulated by Agt gene inactivation, such as glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 1 (Gpd1), carboxylesterase 3 (Ces3), retinol saturase (Retsat), serum amyloid A 3 (Saa3), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 1 (Nod1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (Cxcl12). Additional analysis using mouse adipogenesis PCR arrays detected lower expression levels of adipogenic/lipogenic genes, such as peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (Pparg), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), adipogenin (Adig), and fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, this study directly demonstrates the critical effects of Agt in preadipocytes differentiation, adipocytes lipid metabolism and inflammation. These results further support a potential role for adipose tissue-derived Agt in the pathogenesis of adiposity and obesity-associated metabolic complications.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
