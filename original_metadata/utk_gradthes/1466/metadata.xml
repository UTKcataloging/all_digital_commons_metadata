</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;It was this study&#39;s purpose: (1) to determine if those children admitted to the Church of God Home for Children had legal residence within a 100-mile radius of the institution and (2) to learn if most admissions were referred by ministers of the Church of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A schedule was formulated for use in collecting the data. Table, taken from the schedule, were made so as to examine the hypotheses and indicated areas in which further research could be indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study would show that state of residence for those children accepted has changed to include a wider geographic area. Although 57 percent of accepted referrals came from minister, the figure could be questions as to level of significance. This thesis found a decrease in the population even though the age and sex for admission has remained constant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
