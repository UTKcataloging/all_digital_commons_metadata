</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Computed radiography is a standard medical imaging technology that uses photostimulable storage phosphor imaging plates to create an image.  X-rays create electron hole pairs within the plate which recombine upon stimulation by a laser, producing light which is read out and stored as a digital image.  Modern imaging plates contain an active layer of crystalline storage phosphors embedded in a polymer binder. The resolution of images from these plates is reduced due to light scattering at grain boundaries during readout.   Fluorochlorozirconate (FCZ) glass-ceramic imaging plates containing BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; [barium chloride] [europium]nanocrystals in the orthorhombic phase have been developed to decrease light scattering during readout and improve resolution for applications such as mammography where a high level of detail is required. However, these plates lack the conversion efficiency (CE) of current plates and therefore require a higher x-ray dose to provide sufficient light to produce an image. This work investigates the use of co-doping to increase the CE of FCZ glass-ceramic imaging plates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of fluorochlorozirconate (FCZ) glass samples were produced, replacing the EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with HoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [holmium] to determine the effects of co-doping on light output.  The samples were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry to determine the temperature at which orthorhombic BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystallization occurs.  Thermal treatments were performed to precipitate BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals in the orthorhombic phase, creating a glass ceramic.  The heat treated samples were characterized using phosphorimetry and x-ray diffraction to confirm the crystalline phases present.   Photostimulated luminescence (PSL) experiments were conducted to evaluate light output.  The results indicate that the addition of HoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; increases the CE even though HoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; singly doped FCZ glass ceramics do not exhibit any PSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an effort to reduce the costs of the FCZ glass-ceramic imaging plates, experiments were conducted to see if less costly EuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could be reduced to form the more expensive EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through heating in an inert atmosphere. Three different heating profiles were tested. The percent conversion was evaluated using MÃ¶ssbauer [Mossbauer] spectroscopy.  The results show that EuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be successfully synthesized from EuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
