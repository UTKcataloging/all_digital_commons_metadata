</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Because modem turbine engines have such complex flow fields, extensive testing is required to ensure stability. The testing of these engines and their components is very expensive. To offset testing costs, computer simulations are often used. Several computer simulations have been developed at Arnold Engineering Development Center for this purpose. These codes require stage-by-stage compressor characteristics in order to simulate flow through a compressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A technique to calculate compressor characteristics was developed using a mean line code (MLC). This MLC was modified to include loss and deviation correlations from open literature and to account for the conservation of angular momentum as the flow area changes between blade rows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this research, it was determined that the MLC could predict the compressor total pressure characteristics for the normal operating range within about 4.9-percent difference when compared to data for a single fan rotor compressor. For this same fan rotor, the MLC could predict the compressor total temperature characteristics within 1.2-percent difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also determined that for a single compressor stage, the MLC could predict the compressor total pressure characteristics for the normal operating conditions within I. 7-percent accuracy when compared to data. For this compressor stage, the MLC could predict the compressor total temperature characteristics within 1.0-percent accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
