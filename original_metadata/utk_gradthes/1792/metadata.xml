</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This localized study explored the level of political activity of students at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work. Students were asked to respond to several demographic questions and answer questions regarding the frequency with which they performed certain tasks of political activity. Additionally the study explored relevant literature to establish a framework of national political behavior and political behavior within the field of social work. Political behavior is most strongly predicted by the age of the student with little regard for race, gender, or religious background. Students with a higher level of family history of political interest and those that responded as liberal or very liberal are more likely to engage in a higher level of political activity. Implications for social work educators, administrators, professional, and professional organizations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
