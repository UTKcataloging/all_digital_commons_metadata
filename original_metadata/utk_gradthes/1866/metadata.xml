The sample for this study included 164 university students who were classified as undergraduates and who had never been married. Sociodemographic data indicated that 33% of the participants in the sample were male and 67% were female; those students between the ages of 17 and 20 comprised 69% of the sample, whereas the remaining 31% were aged 21 to 24 years old; and the majority of the sample (88%) were classified as White American. Sixty-five percent of the undergraduates indicated that that their biological parents still were married to each other, and 35% had parents who either were separated or divorced. Data analyses using SPSS revealed significant gender differences for subscription to marriage myths and the dysfunctional relationship belief of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;sexual perfectionism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. There was also a significant difference in beliefs about &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;the sexes are different &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;between the participants from intact families and those from separated or divorced homes. Finally, Whites and non-Whites had significant differences in their beliefs regarding ideas that &lt;em&gt;partners cannot change. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
