</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This thesis is concerned with studies on an effectiveness and impact of lane restriction for large trucks from a left lane on Interstate 40 near Knoxville. The data collection was conducted in July to August 2001 and March to April 2002. The restriction was implemented on August 13, 2001. The lane distribution and individual speed of large trucks in each lane were then gathered to obtain patterns and characteristics of large trucks ‘before’ and ‘after’ the implementation. A database was developed, a data comparison was conducted, and a statistical test was applied. The findings reveal several significant changes of lane distributions and speeds of large trucks and are concluded in the form that can provide the Tennessee department of transportation information in order to make a decision on an existing and future lane use restriction plan.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
