</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The T-34C Airplane has been the primary trainer aircraft of the United States Navy for more than twenty-five years and is reaching the end of its service life. The Navy has delayed the procurement of the replacement T-6A Texan II aircraft for five years, yet does not expect the future training requirements to diminish. This delay in T-6A procurement along with recent observed increases in primary trainer aircraft usage have resulted in the need for the Navy to pay considerable attention to the remaining service life of the T-34C aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thesis will discuss the methodology used to determine future primary trainer aircraft requirements and projected aircraft availability. With analysis of these results it is the authorâ€™s opinion that there will be a projected shortage of over 60 primary trainer aircraft in the coming years. In order to alleviate that shortfall a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) is recommended for the T-34C aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of a SLEP for the T-34C aircraft it is recommended that the main wing spars and carry through structure be replaced instead of conducting a time consuming and costly Damage Tolerance Analysis (DTA) on those components. Replacement of these parts and an increased inspection interval on other airframe components on sixty-three aircraft will alleviate the projected shortfall until the T-6A is delivered in sufficient numbers to maintain the primary training requirement of our future Naval Aviators.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
