</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Rheometers are devices that can be used to measure the rheological properties of polymers. Online rheometers test for rheological properties during a polymer process. Real-time rheological data would eliminate any time delays that accompany off-line rheometers and would provide the feedback information needed for tighter polymer process control. A real-time control system would eliminate the need for an offline rheometer to analyze polymer product properties, thus saving both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Online Rheological Sensor was used to estimate the shear and elongational viscosities of a polymer from measured variables during processing. The Online Rheological Sensor was mounted on a twin-screw extruder in order to measure polymer viscosities for a melt blowing process. The Online Rheological Sensor was equipped with process measurement devices that interfaced with National Instrumentâ€™s LabVIEW. The LabVIEW program calculated and plotted the shear and elongational viscosities of a polymer, along with the process pressures and temperatures. The goal of this research was to work towards using the Online Rheological Sensor as a device to monitor and control polymer viscosities during processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following paper explores methods to control the temperature of the Online Rheological Sensor block to help maintain a constant polymer viscosity. This research also outlines methods in which the Online Rheological Sensor can be used as a feedback control device for a melt blowing line during processing.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
