</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the relationship between banking and the industrial development of a small southern city in the late nineteenth century to determine how the pattern of loans and investments influenced the city&#39;s twentieth century industrial development. State and national banking records for Mechanics&#39; Bank of Knoxville, Tennessee from 1875 through 1907 formed the primary documentary evidence for this study. The bank&#39;s loan activities and investments in new industry were analyzed to ascertain bank&#39;s officers, shareholders and board members financial interests in the companies the bank funded. The study also focused on the ten men who legally controlled the majority of Mechanics&#39; Bank&#39;s stock and authorized and recommended loans to local and regional businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was concluded that Knoxville&#39;s late nineteenth century industrial growth was primarily self-funded, that investments were funneled to those industries promising quick profits at low risk, that new industries centered on the natural resources of the area: coal, timber and marble, and that the bank&#39;s lending pattern centered on conservative, insider knowledge of the probable success of the industries funded.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
