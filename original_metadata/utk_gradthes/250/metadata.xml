</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of applying the Maintenance Error Decision Aid (MEDA) that was developed by Boeing to general aviation maintenance shops, either in its current form or with limited modification. The MEDA investigation process has been implemented successfully by several major airlines and it was assumed that general aviation could also benefit from this safety enhancing process. Because of the nature of the MEDA process, this paper only addresses the feasibility of applying the MEDA process to large shops. After consulting aviation professionals and performing extensive research, a questionnaire was created and sent to numerous general aviation (GA) maintenance managers to determine their opinion of the feasibility of the application of MEDA to GA. A total of 6 responses were received and analyzed, from which it was concluded that the MEDA system could enhance safety in general aviation with certain alterations to the system.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
