</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study was undertaken for the purpose of securing and bringing together scientific information concerning the cavern of the eastern part of Tennessee. Although the presence of such natural phenomena has long been known, the caves of East Tennessee, with one exception, have not previously been described. In recent years, a few of the larger and more favorably located caves have been developed for commercial purposes. These have been widely advertized, and have become well known throughout the eastern part of the State. The caves in East Tennessee that have been developed, or are being developed, are: Craighead Caverns, Cumberland Mammoth Cave, Grand Caverns, Gregory&#39;s Cave, Indian Cave, and Lookout Mountain Cave. The opening of a few other caves in being planned, but definite action towards development has not yet started.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
