</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;By performing a statistical analysis on data collected from the Internet, this study sought to determine if designated characteristics of a university actually affect the bicycle transportation mode and helmet usage on college campuses. The focus group for this research experience involved bicycle commuters affiliated with universities in the United States. Through the establishment of a World Wide Web home page and on-line survey, the author obtained data concerning estimated bicycle and helmet usage percentages, and campus characteristic data from bicyclist responses. The Internet was used as an innovative approach to collecting data. Essentially the participant would simply locate the survey from one of the recreation-bicycle newsgroups, complete the survey, and then submit the survey. Once submitted, the data were transferred into the established researcher&#39;s electronic mail (e-mail) account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bicyclist survey established on the Internet involved ten questions to estimate and evaluate bicycling activities on various campuses. Once the data were obtained, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore and establish two separate models. The dependent variables for model one and model two, respectively, were estimated bicycle usage and estimated bicycle helmet usage. The first model explains the estimated bicycle usage as a function of various university characteristics, and the second model links the estimated helmet usage to various university characteristics. The university characteristics or independent variables consisted of 1994-95 full and part-time undergraduate and graduate combined enrollment, campus size, campus setting, estimated length of bicycle season, mean temperature during bicycle season, mean precipitation/snow during bicycle season, lowest on-campus speed limit, highest on-campus speed limit, campus terrain, automotive congestion rating, designated bicycle lane facility rating, crime rating, automotive parking rating, and bicycle rack facility rating. After establishing two models, a randomly selected group of universities was used to test for accuracy. The accuracy produced from the equations of both models was limited. Therefore, the university characteristics considered had a minimal affect on the bicycle transportation mode and helmet use.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
