</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose&lt;/strong&gt;: To determine the energy expenditure and feasibility of two different DVD-­‐ based prenatal yoga programs (static yoga practice and vinyasa practice). &lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were 25 women in their second trimester (13-­‐28 weeks) who werescreened for pregnancy-­‐related risk factors. The two DVDs used were “Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea” (DVD A) which is a static yoga practice, and “Jennifer Wolfes Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga” (DVD B) which is a flow yoga practice. Both DVDs were approximately 50-­‐55 minutes, and included three phases (warm up, main, cool down). Each subject completed both prenatal DVD routines approximately two weeks apart. The energy expenditure (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, METs, and Kcals) was measured using the Viasys Jaeger Oxycon Mobile system. Enjoyment and feasibility were measured using an adapted version of the PACES questionnaire. &lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;: DVD B had significantly greater average total energy expenditure than DVD A (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;0.001). There was a significant interaction between phase, type of yoga, and VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F(3,21)= 61.15, p&lt;.001. DVD B had significantly greater average total bout heart rate (HR) than DVD A (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;0.001). There was a significant interaction between phase, type of yoga, and HR, F(1,16)=10.318, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.005. There were no differences between yoga DVD program type for feasibility (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.397) or enjoyment (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;=0.886). The rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was significantly higher for DVD B compared to DVD A (14.12 vs. 11, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;0.001). &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;: The energy expenditure of “vinyasa” style prenatal yoga (DVD B) was significantly higher than standard prenatal yoga. Additionally, both DVDs were found to be equally enjoyable and feasible. These results provide data regarding energy expenditure and can be useful in providing options for activity during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
