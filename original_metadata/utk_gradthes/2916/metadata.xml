</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In a world that is under constant change, man must adjust and identify his place in society. Physical education has its roots deep in the educational process. It has progressed and had some set-backs, but it has continually grown and adjusted to innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During various armed conflicts, the physical stamina of man was put to the test. During World War II and the Korean War war, American men were not physically ready. Many of the men displayed poor performance in basic motor skills such as jumping, throwing, falling, and lifting. They did not have a significant degree of skill in any sport which would initiate a desire for participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have improvement there must be change and change is brought about by various means. Mass criticism of the present status or worth of a program causes re-evaluation from within.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
