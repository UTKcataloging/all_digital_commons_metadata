</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purposes of this study were to analyze the growth, structure and operation of the Bradley County Farmers&#39; Market and to determine the factors contributing to the Market&#39;s success. Grower and consumer surveys were used to profile participants and isolate problems and suggestions for market improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Market&#39;s success was attributed to a wide range of factors: (1) technical assistance provided by the Extension Service, (2) a growing middle-class population in Cleveland, (3) preference by residents for fresh, locally-grown products, (4) a large number of retired, part-time and small-scale farmers in the area and (5) the location and special qualities of the market grounds and nearby canning facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Bradley County Farmers&#39; Market appears to have reached a sales plateau, it has the potential to expand through an increase in product variety and extension of the growing season through new cultural practices. The market&#39;s simple structure and quick success suggest that it may be used as a model for other towns in the state.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
