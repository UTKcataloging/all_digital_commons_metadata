In reviewing the literature it was evident that little was known about the factors which influence a young child&#39;s choice of food. This study will contribute some knowledge of the influence of flavor and color in children&#39;s dessert preferences as well as differences in age and sex with respect to the preferences of preschool children in relation to choices of a specific type of dessert. Increased knowledge in the area of children&#39;s flavor and color preferences can be of value in evaluating the present policies during mealtime in nursery schools and to those who are interested in promoting sound food habits and nutrition education.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
