</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The legislature of Tennessee when in session spends much the greatest part of its time and energy in passing acts which are merely of local interest. The great majority of bills passed apply only to some particular county, district, city, or town.  The important place that local acts occupy in legislative affairs of this state may be seen from proclamations of governors calling the legislature to convene in special sessions.  Governor Roberts, in calling an extra session to meet August 9, 1920, explained the reason for making such a call in the following words: &quot;for the purpose of taking action upon the following subjects deemed of sufficient importance to require immediate attention.&quot;  Of the 142 subjects that he listed, the first was to take action upon the amendment to the Constitution of the United States giving women the right of suffrage, which became the 19th amendment.  Following this were 19 other matters of more or less general interest.  However, the 21st subject was &quot;to amend Chapter 416 of the Private Acts of 1919, applying to Anderson County.&quot;  All the remaining proposals for immediate attention were of local application.  A similar proclamation of governor Horton calling for the extra session that began Dec. 2, 1929, classified the proposals to be acted upon as general and local bills.  There were 34 of the former, and 98 of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
