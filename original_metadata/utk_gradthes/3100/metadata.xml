For those who go to college, what are some of the factors that influence their persistence in higher education?  What value in a material way do they obtain by further education?  These are some of the motives that have caused the writer to make a study of the graduates of Science Hill High School, Johnson City, Tennessee, over a period of five years from 1927 to 1931 inclusive.  Stated in a more definite way, the purpose of this study is to survey the activities of the graduate of Science Hill High School through a period of years, following their graduation with special attention given to some of the conditions affecting their persistence in school.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
