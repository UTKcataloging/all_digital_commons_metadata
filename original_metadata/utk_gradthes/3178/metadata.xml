</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to understand the benefits of membership in the Future Farmers of America (FFA) student leadership organization among Tennessee FFA members by surveying members attending Camp Clements FFA Leadership Training Camp. The study focused on the fulfillment of FFA members’ basic human needs as defined by Abraham Maslow (1943). The three needs on which this study focused are: love and belonging, self-esteem, and self-actualization (1943). The study found that a majority of FFA members’ three basic human needs are met due to their involvement in career development events, leadership positions, and other FFA activities. Of all research questions, the highest concentration of members claimed to have a more enjoyable high school experience as a result of their membership in FFA. With that in mind, future research should focus on determining how FFA improves the high school experience. This research could be helpful to other career and technical education organizations and future success within FFA. Moreover, linking the relevance of meeting Maslow’s basic human needs with active participation in student organizations could assist teachers and program advisors as they recruit and retain members.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
