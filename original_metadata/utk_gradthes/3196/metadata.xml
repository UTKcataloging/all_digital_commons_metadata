</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The federal government, in an attempt to bring about metropolitan wide problem solving and to foster economic development on a regional scale, has encouraged the establishment of metropolitan councils of governments and economic development districts. These have been given a planning function, financially supported by the federal government. This thesis is a study of how these new planning agencies relate with other planning agencies in areas where their jurisdictions overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is done in a genera investigation of how the Chattanooga Area Regional Council of Governments and the Southeast Tennessee Development District relate to the local planning agency (the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Regional Planning Commission) and other planning agencies in and around Chattanooga, Tennessee. The investigation is conducted in a case study approach by interviewing various agencies&#39; personnel in an attempt to find out how each agency sees itself in relation to other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main problem facing the planning agencies in the study area is that there is a lack of a clear definition of responsibility concerning each agency&#39;s functions. This is leading to duplication of efforts and in some cases actual conflict between agencies.l&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
