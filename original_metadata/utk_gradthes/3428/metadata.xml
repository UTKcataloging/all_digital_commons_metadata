</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This thesis reports the results of an investigation of environmental modifications of bluegill (&lt;em&gt;Lepomis macrochirus&lt;/em&gt; Rafinesque) in Chilhowee, Loudon, and Norris Reservoirs. The three reservoirs are located in the Tennessee River drainage system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation was carried out between the spring of 1968 and the fall of 1969. Collecting was done by angling using both natural and artificial bait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The evidence obtained by the investigation indicated significant differences occurred in the meristic and morphometric characters of the three bluegill populations when the data was tested statistically. It is concluded that the differences detected were probably due to environmental forces, but genetic differences may also have accumulated due to genetic drift. Even though highly significant differences were detected, no trends or patterns could be established linking the differences with the environmental forces causing the modifications. It is pointed out that further research into this question needs to be carried out by zoologists.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
