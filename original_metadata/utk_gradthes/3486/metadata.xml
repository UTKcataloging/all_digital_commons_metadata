</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This thesis presents the findings of a qualitative examination of the effects of improper burials and the associated cultural impacts on the Acholi population of northern Uganda. Since independence in 1962 Uganda has experienced several internal conflicts, including the notorious struggle between the Lordâ€™s Resistance Army and the Ugandan government. This conflict, which disproportionately affected the Acholi ethnic group, resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and culturally inappropriate burials. These burials are particularity problematic because the Acholi maintain continual ties to the dead through ancestor veneration with proper burial being one of the most important conciliatory rites. In the negotiation between the living and the dead, the social infrastructure that is built around and on mortuary practices is part of the active creation of social relationships and ways of being. Improper burials are, therefore, an obstacle to post-war recovery efforts, as these interments violate beliefs within the Acholi religious system as to how the dead should be treated. As a consequence of this mistreatment these spirits, known as &lt;em&gt;cen&lt;/em&gt;, become angry and cause disease, death, possession, nightmares, and other misfortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research utilizes a psychosocial framework based in grounded theory to explore the impact of improper burials within Acholi communities, the cultural consequences of these interments, local perceptions of what should be done about this issue, and how such endeavors should be accomplished. Additionally, this study also assessed the appropriateness of forensic excavation and DNA identification as a potential solution to improper burials. Though the findings revealed that improper burials and the associated &lt;em&gt;cen&lt;/em&gt; are a significant problem, the desired approach for addressing this issue depends upon whether communities practices tradition Acholi cosmology or Christianity. Based on these results I argue that religion and cosmology are vital coping strategies for addressing &lt;em&gt;cen&lt;/em&gt; on local and institutional levels within northern Uganda. Furthermore, future psychosocial interventions aimed at post-conflict recovery would benefit from a more comprehensive understanding and inclusion of religious beliefs and their effects on local perceptions and needs.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
