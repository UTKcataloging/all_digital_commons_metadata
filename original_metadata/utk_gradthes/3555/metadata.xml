</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Biogeochemical cycling of soil carbon (C) is heavily influenced by conservation agricultural (CA) practices. This study examined SOC stability under three CA practices: reduced nitrogen (N) fertilizer application rate, cover cropping, and zero-tillage implemented for 31 years. Respiration rates measured from a 602-day incubation period were fitted to a double-pool first order exponential model of SOC decomposition. The active [respired] SOC pool showed distinct differences between applications of reduced (34N kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1 &lt;/sup&gt;[-1]) and high fertilization rates (101N kg ha&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) combined with tillage, and suggest that high fertilizer applications with conventional tillage allocated more C into a rapidly turning over C-pool. The slow SOC pool dynamics revealed that given more time, soil C losses would stabilize under reduced N-rates and no-tillage conservation practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More detailed biological controls on broad nutrient acquisition efforts were indicated by extracellular enzyme potential activities of whole soil, and reflected differences between N availability and N form under organic or inorganic additions to this cotton system. The effects on soil physical properties showed that less soil disturbance had a clear effect on the distribution of dry aggregate fractions, where no-tillage had greater abundance of large macroaggregates (&gt; 2 mm) and persisted when combined with cover crop management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macro- (&gt; 0.25 mm) and microaggregates (&lt; 0.25 mm) within conventional tillage systems were distinct from those in no-tillage systems due to greater enzyme activity in total C, N, and phosphorus (P), and could indicate faster decomposition rates in conventional tillage compared to no-tillage management. To determine where soil C was most vulnerable to decomposition across the aggregate fractions, respired C was measured after a short-term incubation study and showed greater mean respired C under small macroaggregates (0.25-1 mm) and microaggregates compared to large and medium (1-2 mm) macroaggregates. However, future research must measure total C from each aggregate fraction to determine if soil aggregates can act as a physical protection barrier to sequester SOC.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
