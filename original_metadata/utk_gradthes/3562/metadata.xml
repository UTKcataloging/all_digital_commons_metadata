</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;During emerging adulthood, young people begin the process of balancing individual and relational role commitments. Whereas development within specific domains, primarily career and relationship (work and love), have been explored separately, it is important to understand how emerging adults divide their attention across multiple individual (i.e. education, employment, athletics, organizational membership) and relational (i.e. friendship, family relationship, romantic partnership) domains during this period and how perceived balance impacts psychosocial functioning in terms of life satisfaction, well-being, and mental health. This study reports on the preliminary scale validation of the Individual and Relational Role Balance Scale (IRRBS) using a college student sample (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 299). This scale re-conceptualizes the work-family balance dichotomy appropriate to adulthood as role balance between the multiple and often fluid individual and relational roles emerging adults inhabit. The full IRRBS and three subscales, Global Balance, Individual Role Compatibility with Relational Roles, and Relational Role Compatibility with Individual Roles, were reliable at Î± &gt; .80 and no group differences in IRRBS scores were found on the basis of age, gender, racial/ethnic background, relationship status, or employment status. Construct validity was achieved with significant correlations in the directions hypothesized between individual and relational role balance and the related constructs of life satisfaction, well-being, and endorsement of mental health symptoms of anxiety and depression and overall psychological distress. Implications for future research and applied applications of the IRRBS are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
