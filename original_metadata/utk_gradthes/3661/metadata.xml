</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP), a large family of enzymes, play an important role in insecticide resistance. Compared to the susceptible strains, the resistant strains of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; show higher expression of one or more &lt;em&gt;Cyp&lt;/em&gt; genes including &lt;em&gt;Cyp6w1&lt;/em&gt;, which maps close to the resistance locus. In the present investigation I examined the &lt;em&gt;Cyp6w1&lt;/em&gt; geneâ€™s role in DDT resistance and inducibility with caffeine, DDT and phenobarbital (PB). Utilizing the Gal4:UAS binary system, I overexpressed CYP6W1 RNA in either a susceptible strain alone or in combination with CYP6A2 or CYP6G1 RNA, which are known to give a low level of DDT resistance. When CYP6W1 was combined with CYP6G1 or CYP6A2, a modest increase in DDT resistance was observed. However, CYP6W1 may not be responsible for this increase because overexpression of CYP6W1 alone did not confer any DDT resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second objective, the 0.1-, 0.5- and 0.9-kb upstream DNAs of the &lt;em&gt;Cyp6w1&lt;/em&gt; gene spanning -1/-95, -1/-510 and -1/-937 bp regions were examined for caffeine, DDT and PB inducibility using the firefly luciferase reporter gene system and transient transfection of &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; S2 cells. Results showed that basal transcriptional activity of the 0.5- and 0.9-kb DNA was 2-fold greater than the activity of the 0.1-kb DNA, but none of the upstream DNA fragments was induced by DDT. While 0.1-kb DNA did not show much induction with any chemical, 0.5-kb DNA showed about 1.5-fold and 2.0-fold inductions following PB and caffeine treatment, respectively. The 0.9-kb DNA, on the other hand, showed almost a 3-fold induction with caffeine or PB. When cells transfected with 0.9-kb or 0.5-kb DNA were treated with a mixture of caffeine and PB, the level of induction was significantly greater than the induction level observed with each chemical alone. Taken together, these results suggest that DNA between -510 and -937 contains cis-acting sequences that give high levels of caffeine and PB induction. It appears that caffeine and PB act via independent pathways because they show a synergistic effect when combined together.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
