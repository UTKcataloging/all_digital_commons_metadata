</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Many international sports such as soccer and rugby believe the future growth and prosperity of the sport would be secured, if they can become established within the US sports market. However, many sports leagues/organizations have attempted to enter into this competitive marketplace with a good number of them failing to either establish themselves or are no longer in existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research study is to investigate the factors of failure behind the North American Soccer League and the Women United Soccer Association utilizing Michael Porter’s Models of Strategy Formation. An analysis of the two failed leagues will be conducted in order to discover what the main reasons behind the failure were for each of these leagues. The intent of this research is to uncover any commonalities which may exist between the reasons of failure for each league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this study, case study methodology will be utilized in order to help coordinate and present the data. This is the case for this study because the researcher is attempting to investigate the reasons behind the failure of the NASL and WUSA and this cannot be conducted or measured in a quantifiable manner. With the data sources for this study being subjective, the qualitative approach provides the best avenue in which to analyze the data for this research. To help contextualize the data for this research, the case study methodology will be employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing how previous sports leagues/organizations have failed to become established within the US sports market from a strategy formation viewpoint can help future leagues/organizations to learn from the mistakes of their counterparts. The research also aims to discover whether the failure of these leagues can be attributed to the environment in which they operated in or to factors which these leagues had a degree of control over. The researcher believes by conducting this study, this will provide a guide to sports leagues/organizations whom are thinking of entering or looking to establish themselves within the multi-billion dollar US sports market.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
