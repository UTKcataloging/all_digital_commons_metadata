<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the attitudes and perceptions of Extension agents related to Tennessee Extension professional associations. The guiding question for this study was: what are the attitudes and perceptions of Extension agents towards Extension professional association membership? Data collection methods included one-on-one interviews with 13 participants who were either members or nonmembers. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis method. This allowed for emerging themes from members, nonmembers and both groups to come forth. Results of this study were divided into the following categories: (a) members and nonmembers, (b) members, and (c) nonmembers. Themes common to members and nonmembers were (a) networking and connection, (b) membership costs, and (c) value. Member only themes included: (a) awards and (b) motivation to join. Nonmember only themes included: (a) lack of information and functional understanding and (b) recruitment. Recommendations for future research revolve around determining specifics of motivation, how to create effective recruitment processes, and what specific ways agentâ€™s value networking.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
