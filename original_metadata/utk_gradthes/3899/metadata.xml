</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This thesis describes and analyzes the student&#39;s eight weeks of field training in the Division of Nutrition of the St. Louis County Health Department. It has an established nutrition unit that provided the student with appropriate background experience for her future role as a public health nutritionist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The field experience gives the student in public health nutrition an opportunity to work with allied health personnel under supervision and to apply the theories and principles of public health learned during the academic year to the practice of public health nutrition in the community. The experience was designed to strengthen the student&#39;s philosophy and practical understanding of public health by introducing her to the practice of public health in the official health agency and the community, to the role of nutrition in the health agency, and to the practice of public health nutrition. Experience in working with other professional personnel within the agency as well as other agencies was also offered. The student was given the opportunity to develop both her professional and personal abilities in carrying out applied nutrition programs in the health agency and community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience provided the student with an overview of the total county health program, the role of nutrition in the program, and an opportunity to observe and participate in activities with nutrition staff members and allied personnel. With this practice and the knowledge acquired in the academic program, the student feels that she progressed toward developing the professional attitudes and skills so necessary for the successful practice of public health nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
