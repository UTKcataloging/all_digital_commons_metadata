</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This research was conducted to identify the self-reported continuing education needs of members of the Public Health Nutrition Practice Group of the American Dietetic Association and to determine the relationships between education, training, and experience factors and public health nutrition practice. The three categories (nutrition, public health, and social/behavioral science and education) of knowledge and skill statements identified in the public health nutrition graduate curriculum guide, &lt;em&gt;Strategies for Success, &lt;/em&gt;were adapted for use in a survey which asked respondents to self-report the level and degree of use in the job of each knowledge/skill using a Likert-like scale. Respondents were asked also a series of demographic questions and questions concerning continuing education format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results showed respondents needed basic continuing education programs dealing with public health competencies and more advanced programs for nutrition topics. In terms of public health nutrition practice, the factors which appeared to have the greatest influence in self-reported level and use of competencies were years experience in public health nutrition and primary position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommendations were made regarding qualifications for three positions in public health nutrition: administrator/manager, direct care service provider, and a combination of the two. Finally, future research needs in the field of public health nutrition were identified.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
