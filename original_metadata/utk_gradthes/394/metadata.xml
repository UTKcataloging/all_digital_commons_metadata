</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this thesis was to determine a path forward to design and implement an on-going Engineering Management Handbook. A review was performed to establish a definition of Engineering Management, the history of Engineering Management, how this history has impacted the Body of Knowledge in Engineering Management over the years, and the current state of the Engineering Management Handbook. Two surveys were performed to discover how users perceive the Handbook. It was found that there was a desire for a useful on-line EM Handbook. This research allows for decisions to be made in the future as the Handbook is updated by showing what subjects and features are most important to users, as well as the need for structure development from the beginning. The features and structure of the Handbook are proposed, along with submission guidelines. The functionality is presented through a series of examples to illustrate the use of the new Engineering Management Handbook.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
