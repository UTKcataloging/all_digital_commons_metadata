</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Previous research has shown the potential of increasing vegetable intake by incorporating the senses into interventions. However, little to no research has specifically looked at the impact that the use of the senses can have on intake of vegetables among preschool-aged children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; The aims of this study were to examine if mean intake of vegetable snacks and/or willingness to try the vegetable snacks would be significantly higher among preschool-age children who participated in a visually appealing and interactive snack activity compared to children who received control vegetable snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Two preschools were selected to participate in the study. Prior to the start of the study, participants colored placemats that contained heart-, star-, and flower-shapes. Parents were surveyed to establish the target vegetable, which was determined to be green pepper. The vegetable was served three times. The control group received the vegetable cut into strips served on white paper plates. The experimental group received the vegetable cut into hearts, stars, and flowers and served on the placemats that children colored at the beginning of the study. The vegetable was weighed before and after each snack time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; There were no significant differences found in intake of the vegetable snack between the control and the intervention group. However there were significant differences in willingness to try and between the genders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Although there were no significant differences in consumption between the groups, the significant findings between the boys and girls highlights a potential area that needs further investigating.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
