The precision of measurements obtained with the Warner-Bratzler shear device as affected by a combination of these temperatures was estimated. Beef roasts from the biceps femoris muscle were cooked at 300&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; to an internal temperature of 170&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F. Four temperature combinations were tested: (1) samples cored and sheared at 150&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F; (2) samples cored at 150&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F, and sheared at room temperature; (3) samples cored and sheared at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F; and (4) samples cored at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F, and sheared at room temperature. A total of 733 shears on 192 cores from 12 roasts obtained from three steers was evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only a slight difference in shear values was associated with the two coring temperatures (P &lt; .10); however, there was a difference (P &lt; .01) associated with the three shearing temperatures. Samples sheard at 150&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F yielded lower average values than were obtained by shearing at room temperature or at 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high degree of variability in shear values was obtained with all temperature combinations. However, the values for samples cored and sheared at the coolest temperature, 40&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F, had the lowest coefficient of variation, 32.3%. Thus, it appeared that the precision of the measurements obtained with the Warner-Bratzler shear apparatus was affected by the temperature of meat samples at the time the cores were removed and sheared.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
