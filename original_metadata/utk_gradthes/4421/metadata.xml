</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;One hundred and twenty market hogs were used to study the effects of delayed slaughter and methods of decreasing liveweight shrinkage and deterioration of the quantitative and qualitative traits of pork carcasses. All hogs were secured from a commercial feedlot and slaughtered under commercial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups were held for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours without feed. Two other groups were held for 72 hours with limited feeding to decrease liveweight shrinkage. Water was provided to all groups &lt;em&gt;ad libitum. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantitative measurements and weights were taken to determine the effects of delayed slaughter on the important economic traits. Delayed slaughter had a significant (P &lt; .05) effect on preslaughter shrinkage and carcass yield. Lean cut yields were not significantly affected. However, belly yields were decreased after 48 hours of delayed slaughter. Quality of lean was not significantly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cured hams were subjected to chemical and organoleptic evaluation. No discernible trends due to delayed slaughter were noted.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
