&lt;p&gt;Supervisors of instruction in the State of Tennessee are necessarily concerned with improving instruction given to the children of the state. This mean, of course, that they are directly concerned with the teaching personnel and what the personnel teach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer has been in supervision for only two years; however, she has some very definite ideas concerning the approach to supervision. One of these ideas is indirectly responsible for this study. That idea is the belief that to improve a school program you must first know what teachers think they are trying to do and how they are going about accomplishing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often it is much easier to talk of doing something that to actually do something--as is said &quot;Easier said than done.&quot; It is important in education to examine what is being done in light of what is being attempted. To evaluate in this manner is to find a basis on which to begin improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
