<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The National Restaurant Association (1999) indicates that coupons are the second most likely marketing tactic to be utilized in the restaurant industry (Hsu &amp; Powers, 2002). Coupons are a part of marketing a product because the consumer perceives savings (Lichtenstein &amp; Netemeyer, 1991). Customers are the vital driving force in the hospitality industry and it is what customers think and feel, not what the operators or corporations do that defines the &lt;em&gt;marketing&lt;/em&gt; orientation (Hsu, &amp; Powers, 2002). Whether customers are generated through creating new ones, stealing them from competitors or they are bound by loyalty, the hospitality industry requires customers for survival (Lewis, &amp; Chambers, 2000). Although they are viable marketing strategy, improperly used, the coupon promotions could have a negative impact (Hsu &amp; Powers, 2002). Coupons are often used in service companies, but little is known as to their influence. The bulk of the information provided encompasses retail couponing and may serve as a basis for better understanding how coupons affect the food service industry (Taylor, 2000). There are two consumer choices; purchase or nonpurchase (Gonul &amp; Srinivasan, 1996).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the use of coupons on the decision process to purchase, as well as the consumerâ€™s motivations, behaviors and attitudes toward coupons in the full-service restaurant segment. A research instrument was completed by a randomized sample of 246 consumers in the Knoxville, TN market. Further a purchase or no purchase experiment as conducted with the sample and an additional population. The results from both interventions were analyzed and applied to implications effecting the full-service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Consumers report they want coupons to be available. However, the results of this study indicate coupons not be well utilized.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
