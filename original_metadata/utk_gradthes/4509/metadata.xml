</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Virginia&#39;s horse culture combined with the colonists&#39; obsession with immediate gratification created the perfect ingredients for the formation of quarter-racing. Not only did short racing afford the ideal outlet for tidewater Virginians&#39; independence, competitiveness, and materialism but it also functioned as a tool to police social order. Consequently, seventh and eighteenth-century tidewater Virginians embraced their new innovation, transforming it from an ad hoc drag race into a formalized competition complete with specially made race courses, racing covenants that stipulated the how, when, and where of the race, and even public notices announcing upcoming events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result Quarter-racing became one of the most popular colonial sporting events and developed into a cultural icon with significant social ramifications. However, as the tidewater region&#39;s economy stabilized and tobacco practices evolved, the region became enamored with more dignified pursuits causing a decline in short racing&#39; s popularity. With a decline in short racing&#39;s popularity along the seaboard, quarter-racing all but disappeared by 1730. It was subsequently replaced by the more sophisticated and formalized thoroughbred race- a sport that more successfully allowed eighteenth-century gentlemen more effective social control. However, rather than disappearing, the versatile short race found a new home in the borderlands of the early republic. At the tum of the Eighteenth Century, American pioneers needed a fast-paced outlet. Lacking the means and time to pursue mile-lone racing, western migrants quickly adopted quarter-racing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite its eventual replacement, quarter-racing dominated colonial Virginia&#39;s sporting world for close to one hundred years. Much like its creators, short racing was a combination of new and old. While it was loosely based on traditional mile races, Virginians adapted European practices to fit their new environment and ensuing needs. The result was a sport that was exhilarating, provided quick results, and easily fit into the colonists&#39; new life style. Thus, the events surrounding the creation of this unique sport, its rise in popularity, and its eventual westward expansion offer a significant window of opportunity for understanding eighteenth-century tidewater Virginian culture.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
