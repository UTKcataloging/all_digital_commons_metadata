</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This descriptive study focused on assistive technology (AT) service provider exploration of the Student, Environment, Tasks, Tools (SETT) Framework during assessment and decision-making. Review of the literature is suggestive that employment of an effective model to structure team assessment, such as the SETT Framework, can prevent the phenomenon of device abandonment. Participants used for this study were identified as AT service providers through their participation in Tennessee sponsored training opportunities. All participants were involved in the provision of AT services in public school settings. Completion of an on-line survey designed to assess SETT Framework exploration was required of all participants. Results of this study indicate that the participant group reports SETT Framework exploration in AT practice. Demographic data collected reveal that teachers may be the least familiar with the SETT Framework.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
