</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;For decades, musicians from all over the world have been studying the music and rhythms of West Africa.  Although some literature exists on the construction of rhythmic instruments, very little research has examined the impacts of environmental change on instrument making processes.  This thesis represents an ethnographic investigation of the impacts of deforestation on drum making in Ghana, West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on this topic was conducted during the summer of 2003 in the Volta, Eastern, and the Northern Regions of Ghana.  The research methods included participant observation, formal and informal interviews, botanical methods for plant identification, and literature searches.  Informed consent was obtained from all participants in this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to interview drum makers throughout Ghana and obtain local perspectives on how changes in the environment, especially deforestation, have impacted the acquisition of resources, specifically plant and animal species, used in the drum making process.  In addition, the objective was to seek out information regarding the causes of deforestation and make connections among local, national, and international forces and the struggles of drum makers.  Thus, a political ecological lens was used to analyze the collected data and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This investigation revealed that the destruction of forests in Ghana has impacted drum making in Ghana and continues to pose threats to current drum technologies.  The impacts vary, however, due to differences in local geography, preferred plant and animal species used for construction, eco-histories, and drum technologies.  Acquisitions of resources is becoming increasingly difficult for drum makers, and in the lower Volta Region, environmental change is linked to the emergence of a new drum technology.  Deforestation is a result of numerous factors, including agricultural expansion, timber exportation, population growth, fuel wood extraction, and mining.  This study contributes to the anthropological, political ecological, and ethnomusicological literature, and provides insight into how broader political and economic forces affect life-ways and traditions at local levels.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
