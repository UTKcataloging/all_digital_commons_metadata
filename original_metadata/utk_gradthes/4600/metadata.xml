</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Body composition is an important measurement for health assessments in older adults. The purpose of this study was to evaluate percent body fat (%BF) estimations in older adults by the Tanita, a two-compartment model (Siri 2-C) and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) compared to a three-compartment model (Lohman 3-C). Fifty-two females and fifty men between the ages of 54 and 75y volunteered for the study. The estimate of % BF from the Tanita was measured using the ‘adult’ mode. The Bod Pod was used to determine body density (D&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;) for the 2-C and 3-C. DXA was used to obtain an estimate of %BF, and determine BMC for use in the 3-C. Compared to the 3-C estimate of %BF (26.1 ± 1.0%), %BF in males was significantly underestimated by Tanita (22.1 ± 0.8%), and overestimated by 2-C (27.6 ± 09%) and DXA (28.6 ± 0.9%) (P&lt; 0.001). The bias and limits of agreement for all methods in males were: Tanita, -3.93 ± 10.3; 2-C, 1.53 ± 3.38; DXA, 2.51 ± 6.36. Compared to the 3-C estimate of %BF (39.2%), %BF in females was significantly underestimated by Tanita (36.4 ± 1.2%; P &lt; 0.001) and overestimated by DXA (40.5 ± 1.2%; P = 0.013). There was no significant difference in females between the 3-C and 2-C estimates of %BF (39.2 ± 1.2% vs. 39.3 ± 1.2% respectively, P &gt; 0.05). The bias and limits of agreement for all methods in females were: Tanita, -2.85 ± 8.66; 2-C, 0.05 ± 3.24; DXA 1.27 ± 5.64. This study suggests that the techniques used in this investigation are not interchangeable when estimating %BF in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
