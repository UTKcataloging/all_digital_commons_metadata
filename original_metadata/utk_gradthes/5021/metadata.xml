<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Emerging adulthood (ages 18-29) is theorized to be a distinct developmental period in the life course that embodies many unique experiences, including within the realms of sex and sexuality. Sexual activity among emerging adults is well documented; however, limited attention has been given to the association between developmental perceptions and endorsed motivations for sex. This study examined how perceptions of emerging adulthood status are associated with college students’ (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 1,109) endorsed motivations for sex (i.e., enhancement, intimacy, and coping), after controlling for demographic and known correlates of motivations for sex. Identity exploration, experimentation/possibilities, and negativity/instability were positively associated with enhancement motivations for sex, whereas only identity exploration was positively associated with intimacy motivations for sex. Lastly, negativity/instability was positively associated with coping motivations for sex, and self-focus and feeling “in-between” were negatively associated with coping motivations for sex. Implications for research and sexuality education for emerging adult populations are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
