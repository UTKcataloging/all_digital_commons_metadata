<abstract>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; is an important zoonotic mastitis pathogen that has significant effects on animal and human health. &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; is also a foodborne pathogen that causes food poisoning through its diverse enterotoxins. Some studies showed that &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains that cause infection in a particular host are genetically distinct and are host specific, although most strains are believed to be infective to a wide range of host species. However, there are no clearly defined clonal patterns of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; that possess certain virulence factors responsible for causing a disease. The objectives of this study were: 1) evaluate clonal diversity of &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates from cases of bovine mastitis 2) determine staphylococcal enterotoxin production patterns 3) evaluate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; adhesion and invasion ability of dominant strains on bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T cells). Milk samples from bovine mastitis were evaluated at Tennessee Quality Milk Laboratory (TQML) for causative agents. Overall, 111 &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains were isolated and evaluated for genetic diversity by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and for presence of toxin genes that encode for staphylococcal enterotoxins (&lt;i&gt;sea&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;seb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sej&lt;/i&gt;) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (&lt;i&gt;tsst-1&lt;/i&gt;) by PCR. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; adhesion and invasion ability of the dominant strains were evaluated on mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T). We found 16 PFGE types (dominant clones) ranging from A â€“ P. The PFGE type M is the most prevalent of all 16 PFGE types. The PCR results of enterotoxins genes showed that some of these strains were positive for staphylococcal enterotoxin genes including &lt;i&gt;seb&lt;/i&gt; (11.7%), &lt;i&gt;sec&lt;/i&gt; (2.7%), &lt;i&gt;see&lt;/i&gt; (0.9%) and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (&lt;i&gt;tsst-1&lt;/i&gt;) (7.2%), whereas most strains (75.7%) were negative for enterotoxin genes. In addition, evaluation of association of PFGE types, enterotoxins and other virulence factors, that were evaluated previously, showed that PFGE types O and M tend to cluster with beta-hemolysin, absence of enterotoxins and susceptibility to antimicrobials. Analysis of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; adhesion to and invasion into MAC-T cells showed relatively higher number of O strain adhered to and invaded into MAC-T cells followed by M and I strains however were not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
