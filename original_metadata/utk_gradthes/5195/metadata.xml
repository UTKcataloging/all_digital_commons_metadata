<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This thesis explores the relationship between two variables, downtown parking and residential development, based on a thorough literature review and interviews of selected cities. From the literature review, key factors were identified for evaluating the relationship between these two variables and then used to select comparable cities to Knoxville, TN. Trends and recommendations for the downtown parking situation are based on the information gathered from the selected cities. Therefore, the literature review serves as the basis for the study of residential development and parking downtown. Essentially, larger cities are experiencing more residential growth and are creating programs and initiatives for their parking. Knoxville is above the curve of residential development for medium-sized cities. Therefore, the recommendations for Knoxville are based on the experiences of larger cities.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
