<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The neutron-deficient nucleus 123La was studied via the 92Mo(40Ca, 2ap) reaction at a beam energy of 184 MeV. Previously known bands were extended to much higher spin, and in two cases the structures are now observed near 40h. In addition, three new sequences were identified and linked into previously known bands. The lowest (pi, a) = ( +, -½) structure displays similar characteristics to analogous bands in 12 71129 La which have been suggested as examples of smooth band termination. Cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky calculations were compared with the experimental data in 123La to determine whether this band is approaching a termination state as well.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
