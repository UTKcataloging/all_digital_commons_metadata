<abstract>&lt;p&gt;In this study, the high injury rate in the construction industry is analyzed to identify trends. The study specifically addresses injuries that occurred in highway and street construction from 2002 to 2003 in Tennessee. Injury rates were established for injuries that occurred in overtime and during weeks of accelerated work. Injury rates by day of the week and craft were also established. This study found that days with greater than 8 hours worked and weeks with high percentages of over time pay affected injury rates.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
