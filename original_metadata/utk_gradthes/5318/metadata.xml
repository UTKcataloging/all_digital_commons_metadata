<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This essay examines how historians have perceived the role of Gen. Lucius Clay in the 1961 Berlin Crisis. It analyzes fourteen secondary sources to determine how they portray General Clay and why they present him as they do. It begins by briefly recounting the events leading up to the Berlin Crisis and the primary incidents during 1961. As much as possible, this version has been completed using the documentary evidence. Once the facts have been relayed, the essay delves into the content analysis of these fourteen sources. Finally, the essay argues that the historians who portray Clay in a more reckless light present a more valid view than those who assert that his actions were justified and that though action may have been necessary, the steps General Clay took were dangerously provocative.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
