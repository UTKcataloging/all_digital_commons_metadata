This thesis develops models using logistic regression to improve the understanding of the key factors that influence the locations of existing wood-using bioenergy and biofuels plants, and other wood-using plants. The scope of the study is 13 Southeastern states.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Logistic regression models are developed at the state and regional levels. The resolution of the study is the ZIP Code tabulation area (ZCTA). There are 9,416 ZCTAs in the 13â€“state study region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because a small number of woody biomass-using bioenergy and biofuels plants exist relative to the large number of traditional woody biomass-using facilities (e.g., wood composites, sawmills, and secondary mills), two sample groups are developed. The first group combines all wood-using mills with wood-using bioenergy and biofuels plants, and compares ZCTAs with these types of mills with ZCTAs that do not contain any such facilities. This follows a more modern planning view of total woody biomass management. The second group combines only one type of mill, pulp and paper mills, with wood-using bioenergy and biofuels plants, and compares ZCTAs of these mill types with ZCTAs that do not contain such facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For both groups in the entire study region, logging residues harvesting costs (negative influence) and the availability of thinnings within an 80-mile haul distance (positive influence) are statistically significant factors (p-value &lt; 0.0001) in the logistic models. Population is statistically significant and has a negative influence on site location for six of the thirteen states in the region (p-values ranged from &lt; 0.0001 to 0.0197) for the first group. Twenty-five optimal locations in the Southeastern states (ZCTAs) are predicted from the logistic regression models. A de-clustering algorithm is developed as part of this study to avoid locating potential bioenergy and biofuels sites in close proximity to competing mills within same ZCTA.  ______________________&lt;/p&gt;
