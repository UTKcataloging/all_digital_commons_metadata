<abstract>&lt;p&gt;Dust generated from military vehicle maneuvers on unpaved roads and trails is a serious issue that affects military readiness, human health and safety, and environmental quality. Dust emissions from military training exercises at Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA) was one of the concerns identified by U.S. Army in maintaining environmental compliance during the Stryker transformation. A comparative evaluation of the influence of transformation on dust generated at Pohakuloa Training Area (PTA), Hawaii was performed. Stryker transformation was a process involving the shift of the 25th Infantry, 2nd Brigade from a Light Infantry to a Stryker Brigade. Vehicles were tracked using GPS vehicle tracking systems. A pre transformation study was conducted in November 2006 using Garmin 18 GPS receivers to track Medium Tactical Vehicles, (MTV-M1083) and High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles, (HMMWV-M998), belonging to the 1-21 Battalion of the 2nd Brigade.A post transformation tracking study involved 8-wheeled Infantry Carrier Vehicles (ICV) called Strykers (M1126) of 1-21 Battalion, 2nd Brigade, conducted in April 2007. The relative amount of dust generated pre and post transformation exercise on different unpaved road segments at PTA was estimated using dust emission estimation model, developed by US EPA (1979). During the pre transformation exercise, 11 vehicles (HMMWV&#39;s and MTV&#39;s combined) traveled an estimated 221.5 km for a period of 10 days with an average velocity of 5.79 m/s and generated 2,090 kg/km dust per Battalion day. During the post transformation exercise, 16 vehicles (Strykers) traveled 128 km for a period of 10 days with an average velocity of 5.45 m/s and emitted 24,654 kg/km dust per Battalion day. Dust emissions were sensitive to soil silt and average velocity. Critical road segments of PTA having greater potential for dust emissions were identified using ArcGIS 9.1, mostly on Redleg trail and Lava road.Critical road segments constituted nearly 2% of the roads at PTA and contributed about 42% of the total dust generated during the pre and post transformation exercises. Training after post transformation generated about 10 times more dust when compared to pre transformation.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
