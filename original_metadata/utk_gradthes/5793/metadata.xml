<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The history of brickmaking in Knoxville and Knox County, Tennessee is presented in conjunction with an analysis of quantitative data collected from 31 brick structures in the same area. This information is used to answer technological questions about brickmaking in the study area and to compare the sequence of changes in this technology with that for the United States in general as proposed by Walker in 1971. Analysis of this data reveals that certain factors delayed the introduction of brickmaking machines to Knoxville until 1885. From the late 18th century until the early 20th century, local bricks were made to standard common and modified English statute standards. The popularity of these standards during the 19th century follows a slightly different pattern locally than Walker&#39;s sequence for the United States. Although bricks from the study area are slightly thicker than the limits of standard common and modified English statute standards, their Index Numbers still fall within the range allowed for these standards.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
