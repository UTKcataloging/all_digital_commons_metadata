<abstract>&lt;p&gt;This thesis, entitled &quot;The Geology of the Graveston Quadrangle, Union and Knox Counties, Tennessee&quot; is one in a series being undertaken by graduate students in the Department of Geology and Geography, University of Tennessee. The area under study had been mapped previously by Arthur Keith (U.S.G.S. Maynardville folio, no. 75, 1901) on a scale of 1:125,000. The geologic mapping by the present writer was done on the Tennessee Valley Authority base map (Graveston Quadrangle, 164-NE) which has a scale of 1:24,000. The reconnaissance field work was undertaken in the fall of 1948 using the Maynardville folio for purpose of general information. Field work was delayed during the late winter and early spring months due to inclement weather conditions. During late spring and early summer the field work was renewed and subsequently completed in July, 1949.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
