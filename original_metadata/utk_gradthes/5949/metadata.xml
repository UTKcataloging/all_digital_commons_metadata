<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine and compare the levels of technology use among teachers based on (a) teacher years of experience, (b) teacher knowledge of computers, and (c) teacher department affiliation. The respondents included all of the teachers at Bearden High School (Knoxville, Tennessee) during the spring semester of 2002. Each respondent reported his or her level of technology use using the survey instrument developed by the researcher. The results were then compared on the basis of the above-mentioned independent variables using the Spearman rho and Tukey&#39;s statistical tests. Finally, conclusions and implications were presented to understand the factors involved in and thereby increase the amount of technology use in secondary schools.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
