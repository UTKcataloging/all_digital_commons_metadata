<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a low ropes course experience in a graduate-level course in reinforcing major teaching concepts and increasing student application to a work setting. Empirical research documenting the effectiveness of the low ropes course as a teaching aide is minimal to nonexistent in higher education settings, even though the low ropes course continues to be used as a teaching tool. The practice of using experiential teaching methods in general is increasing in higher education and is accepted in many cases as best practice. This study attempts to provide empirical evidence supporting the use of the low ropes course as a teaching aid. The results of the study documented that the low ropes course used as a teaching aide in the graduate course was effective in reinforcing the major teaching concepts and increased the transfer of the learning to work settings.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
