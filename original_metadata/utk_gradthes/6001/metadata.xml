<abstract>&lt;p&gt;To determine general educators&#39; satisfaction of and satisfaction with the Individualized Education Program (IEP) process, a survey was developed and administered to forty-three general educators in grades 1-12 in a rural county in Northeast Tennessee. The survey was based on a survey used in a larger scale study in Utah. The survey assessed general educators&#39; perceptions of and satisfaction with: their role in the IEP process; their level of preparation; IEP paperwork; roles of others involved in the IEP process; and overall IEP process. Results indicated that general educators in this sample are generally satisfied with the IEP process; further there were no differences in attitudes and satisfaction based on grade level taught, number of years taught, and number of special education courses taken.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
