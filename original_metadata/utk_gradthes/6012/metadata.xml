<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this thesis is to explore conflict management styles and communication competence in mediation settings. Specifically, this study examines the relationship between preferred styles of conflict management and communication competence in mediators. In addition, the study explores the perceptions of mediation training among volunteer mediators, judgments of communication competence in mediation sessions, and judgments of communication competence across mediation situations. Results of this study suggest three things. First, results suggest that perceptions of communication competence are independent of preferred conflict management strategies. Second, results of this study showed that mediators perceived themselves to be competent communicators, despite their choice of conflict management style. Finally, results support the notion that effective communicators differ from effective communicators who are mediators. Findings provide new insight into the relationship between conflict management strategies and communication competence in mediators. This study benefits academia and mediation practitioners alike by providing new empirical information concerning the conflict management strategies and communication behaviors of mediators. This study also provides information regarding the perceptions of mediation training by mediators.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
