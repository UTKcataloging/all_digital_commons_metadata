</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Underreporting in dietary assessment has been linked to dietary restraint (DR) and social desirability (SD).  Thus, this study investigated accuracy of reporting energy intake (EI) of a laboratory meal during a 24-hour dietary recall (24HR) in 38 healthy, college-aged (20.3 +/- 1.7 years), normal-weight women (22.4 +/- 1.8 kg/m2), categorized as high or low in DR and SD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants consumed a meal (sandwich wrap, chips, fruit, and ice cream) and completed a telephone 24HR.  Accuracy of reported intake = (((reported intake - measured intake)/measured intake) x 100) [positive numbers = overreporting].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overreporting of EI was found in all groups (meal accuracy rate = 43.1 +/- 49.9%).  An interaction of SD x individual foods (p &lt; 0.05) occurred.  SD-High as compared to SD-Low more accurately reported EI of chips (19.8 +/- 56.2% vs. 117.1 +/- 141.3%, p &lt; 0.05) and ice cream (17.2 +/- 78.2% vs. 71.6 +/- 82.7%, p &lt; 0.05).  An effect of SD occurred, where SD-High as compared to SD-Low more accurately reported meal EI (29.8 +/- 48.2% vs. 58.0 +/- 48.8%, p &lt; 0.05).  For measured meal EI, an effect of DR occurred where DR-High consumed less than DR-Low (437 +/- 169 kcals vs. 559 +/- 207 kcals, p &lt; 0.05).  An interaction of DR x food type (p &lt; 0.05) occurred where DR-High as compared to DR-Low consumed less sandwich wrap (156 +/- 63 kcals vs. 210 +/- 76 kcals, p &lt; 0.05) and ice cream (126 +/-73 kcals vs. 190 +/- 106 kcals, p &lt; 0.05).  For reported meal EI, an effect of DR occurred where DR-High reported consuming less than DR-Low (561 +/- 200 kcals vs. 818 +/- 362 kcals, p &lt; 0.05).  An interaction of DR x individual foods (p &lt; 0.05) occurred where DR-High reported consuming less ice cream than DR-Low (145 +/- 91 kcals vs. 302 +/- 235 kcals, p &lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overreporting EI from a laboratory meal was prevalent.  However, those high in SD were more accurate in reporting intake, particularly of high-fat foods.  Future research is needed to investigate factors that contribute to overreporting.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
