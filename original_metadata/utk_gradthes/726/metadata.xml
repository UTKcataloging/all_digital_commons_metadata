</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Engineering education reform has been a topic of discussion for the last twenty years.  The concern has only intensified in recent years as stakeholders strive to improve quality in engineering education.  Today, stakeholders are recognizing that one of the keys to successful engineering education reform is in taking a systems view of higher education.  Academic departments within the higher education system are organized around academic disciplines for the purpose of creating, transferring, and applying knowledge in three principal areas:  teaching, research and service.  This study addresses the need for quality improvement in the engineering higher education system by first completing a literature review in order to identify recurring themes on the issue.  A proposed systems view is presented.  The thesis builds a case for viewing students as the primary stakeholder based on stakeholder theory concepts.  The application of a systems view is then used to identify the impacts of the recurring issues on the identified stakeholders of the system.  Recommendations are made to address the systemâ€™s issues.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
