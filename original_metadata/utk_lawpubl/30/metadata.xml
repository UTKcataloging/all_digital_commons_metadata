</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This  is an edited, annotated transcript of a conference panel discussion on  feminism, sex, and gender in law, legal education, and legal  scholarship. The transcript reflects widely divergent views of the place  of feminism, sex, and gender in the law and legal scholarship.  Moreover, the panelists differ as to the role feminism has played in the  lives of women as law students and practicing attorneys. In the latter  part of the transcript, the panelists&#39; remarks focus in on hotly debated  issues surrounding possible gender (or sex) and racial bias in LSAT  testing and the innate abilities of women and men as they relate to  learning and practicing law. This portion of the piece is exceptionally  timely, following on the controversial January 14, 2005 remarks by  Harvard University President Lawrence H. Summers relating to inherent  differences between men and women in career choice and success.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
