</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In basing his consideration of the age-old problems of book selection and collection development on &quot;the first work to deal with the whole aspect of setting up a library,&quot; Dr. Harrer gives a pleasing scholarly tone to his up-to-the-minute treatment of today&#39;s university concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. McAnally&#39;s interest in the problems of effective interlibrary loan service has been evidenced in his publications and in his work as chairman of the Association of Research Libraries&#39; Interlibrary Loan Study Committee. He presents an expert&#39;s report of what has been done in this aspect of interlibrary cooperation, the inherent problems, and the need for more active efforts toward their solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zachert, exhibiting in her lecture the traits of an excellent teacher, gives an enlightening account of the role of the adult learner in the planning and execution of programs of continuing education for librarians.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
