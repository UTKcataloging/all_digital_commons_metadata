<abstract>&lt;p&gt;In June 2009 the UT Libraries conducted focus groups with graduate students, undergraduate students, and faculty. The purpose of the focus groups was to help guide implementation of the Primo search and delivery platform and associated redesign of the Libraries&#39; website. The objectives of the focus groups were to gather information to help the design team determine: what information should be most prominent on the website homepage, what other design elements should be incorporated into the homepage design, and what resources do users want to search from the main search box and how should those resources be labeled?&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
