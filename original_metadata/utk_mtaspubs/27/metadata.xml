</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In May, 1982, MTAS published the Local Government Public Works Standards &amp; Specifications, a comprehensive document which provided a wealth of information to municipal engineering and design personnel. In order to make the document more usable and understandable by elected and appointed officials, it was determined that a supplemental companion document should be produced to accompany the Standards &amp; Specifications. The result is this publication, A Guide To Public Works Standardsâ€”An Introduction to Local Government Public Works Standards &amp; Specifications, which provides a basic conceptual foundation to the entire subject. It should be especially helpful to elected officials, planning commissions and administrators in understanding the need for and purpose of public works standards and specifications as presented in the original document.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
