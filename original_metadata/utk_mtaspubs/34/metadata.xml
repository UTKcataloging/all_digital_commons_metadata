</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This publication is primarily the compiled results of surveys sent to the cities in Tennessee. Electric rate information was supplied by the Tennessee Valley Authority and population figures were taken from the 1985 Certified Population of Tennessee Incorporated Municipalities. Approximately, one-hundred and thirty cities responded in part or whole to the survey. If data from a city appears in one section but not another it indicates the city either does not provide that service or information was not included in the survey response for some other reason. The data is divided into five major utility areas: Water; Sewer; Natural Gas; Garbage Collection and Disposal; and Electricity.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
