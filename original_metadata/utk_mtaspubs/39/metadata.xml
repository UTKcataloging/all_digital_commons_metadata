</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;The application of the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to municipal government has proven to be one of the higher impact items with which Tennessee Cities have been required to deal with over the past several years. MTAS has prepared several technical bulletins on this issue and has participated in state-wide briefings that were held in the past year. In an attempt to provide you a comprehensive look at the Fair Labor Standards Act and its overall impact on your municipality, MTAS is providing you with this publication, &quot;Guide to Compliance With the Fair Labor Standards Act for Tennessee Municipalities,&quot; which was prepared by Richard Ellis, MTAS Management Consultant located in Knoxville.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
