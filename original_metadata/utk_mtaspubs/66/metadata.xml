</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;In the year ending June 30, 1975, the staff of the Municipal Techincal Advisory Service completed work on 622 projects, made 2,107 field visits to cities, responded to 711 reference questions, provided 239 ordinances and 1,548 other materials, and answered an uncounted number of inquiries and questions from municipal officials. Total expenditures for regular programs (excluding the HUD-TML-MTAS community development program) approximated $765,000. The sources of funds were: cities&#39; share of state sales tax distribution $339,000; State General Fund appropriation $288,000; federal grants $84,000; and reserve $54,000. In this report on MTAS&#39; 26th year of operations we have included descriptions of typical projects which hopefully will give the reader a picture of the kind of work done by our staff. We continue to say, as we have said over the years to municipal officials: &quot;We are always at your service.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
