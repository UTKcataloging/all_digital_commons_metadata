</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;This study used the Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior (IMCHB) as a conceptual guide to explain the correlates of children&#39;s diet and physical activity and explore the relationships of sex with their diet and physical activity of the school-aged child. A descriptive correlational study was conducted on 371 fifth-grade students and their parents. Information on the family&#39;s demographics, health experience, social influence, and environmental resources was collected, as well as data on the children&#39;s intrinsic motivation, cognitive appraisal, and affective response to food/physical activity. Children&#39;s self-reports on diet and physical activity were collected, as were parents&#39; self-reports on health habits. Food preferences and diet self-efficacy explained the most variance in diet behavior for girls and boys. Girls scored healthier on food preferences and diet self-efficacy than did boys, but no difference was detected in their diet behavior. Girls participated in more low-intensity physical activity, but boys participated in more high-intensity physical activity than did girls. Findings provide strong support for the use of the IMCHB to explain children&#39;s diet but weak support for the explanation of children&#39;s physical activity. Further study of additional factors predictive of physical activity is indicated.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
