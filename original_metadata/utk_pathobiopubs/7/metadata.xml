<abstract>&lt;p&gt;The main aims of this study were to elucidate the effect of green tea catechins on Nudix-type motif 6 (NUDT6) suppression and to characterize NUDT6&#39;s biological activity. Our microarray data showed that the green tea component epicatechin-3-gallate suppressed NUDT6 expression, and this was confirmed by RT-PCR. Subsequently, the use of different catechins showed that the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was stronger than that of other catechins. At the posttranscriptional level, EGCG decreased the RNA stability of NUDT6, indicating it as a potential mechanism of NUDT6 suppression. Further cloning of the 3&#39; untranslated region of human NUDT6 mRNA resulted in reduced luciferase activity by EGCG treatment. This effect was at least, in part, mediated by the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and p38MAPK pathways. Finally, increased cell proliferation and cell growth in soft agar were observed in NUDT6-overexpressing cells. These findings provide a novel mechanism for the suppression of the proliferative gene NUDT6 by green tea catechins in human colorectal cancer. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Inc.
