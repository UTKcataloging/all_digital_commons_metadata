</disciplines><abstract>&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill once remarked that, &quot;The outside of a horse is good for the inside of a person.&quot; Nowhere is this more evident than with equine assisted therapy modalities. As highly sensitive social animals who possess a profound awareness of nonverbal communication, horses mirror human thoughts and feelings and provide immediate feedback to people who interact or attempt to interact with them. This dynamic creates a rich opportunity to use the horses&#39; sensitivity as an avenue toward emotional growth and development through the grieving process for children and adults. This workshop introduces participants to the healing power of the horse in grief counseling and will provide information regarding individual reflection, effective evaluation techniques being developed to address the stress levels of the horses in relation to grief work, addressing the horse as a member of the team and the reaction to the death of that team member, activity ideas associated with the value and benefits of equine assisted grief counseling and suggested programmatic structure incorporating the EAGALA Model.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
