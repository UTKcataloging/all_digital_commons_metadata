Yet, there are highly dysfunctional human-animal relationships which do occur, meriting attention and remediation. One of the most perplexing and problematic human-animal relationships is encountered in cases of animal hoarding - a deviant behavior associated with extremely deleterious conditions of co-morbid animal and self-neglect. Adult Protective Services workers are often called upon to intervene in behalf of the animal hoarder. Yet, their intervention may be adversely affected by theoretical and methodological dilemmas with these complex cases. To intervene most effectively, it becomes critical to elucidate some of the developmental factors of animal hoarding behavior and its correlation with self neglecting behaviors in general. This presentation provides a diagnostic perspective as derived from the presenterâ€™s research and clinical experience. An analysis of the complex dynamics of the relationship between animal hoarders and their pets is presented in conjunction with accepted theories of self-neglect. With enhanced knowledge and understanding of animal hoarding, human service professionals will be better prepared to respond to these clients; evoke greater rapport and cooperation; and engage in the interdisciplinary efforts which are essential for optimal resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</abstract>
